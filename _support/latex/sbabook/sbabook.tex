\chapter*{About this document}

This document is both the showcase and documentation of the SBAbook document
class.
You are of course encouraged to check its code, as a source of concrete examples.

The primary goals of the SBAbook class are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to provide a nice design for the Square Bracket Associates books,
\item to work as an export target for
  \hrefnote{https://github.com/pillar-markup}{Pillar}, the documentation markup
  used in the \hrefnote{http://pharo.org}{Pharo project}.
\end{itemize}
It is therefore meant more as a convenience class than a generic book class.
In fact, SBAbook itself is pretty small; it relies heavily on the
\hrefnote{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir}{Memoir class} and on a selection of
additional packages, which it parameterizes to implement a specific design, from
page layout and typography to semantic markup.

The result is a class that should work well for technical books and should still
be pretty flexible, but which also has a few requirements and makes technical
choices on its own.
This document will thus only describe the specifics of SBAbook and its requirements.

\section{Font choices}

In technical writing, and especially using \LaTeX{}, it's tempting to try to use
fonts as a semantic markup of sorts; unfortunately, this only results in a
jumble of too many fonts and uselessly noisy paragraphs.
Granted, a technical book can never be as minimal as a novel typeset in a single
size, single weight roman font, but some restraint should help maintain a clear
visual hierarchy.
We've thus tried to keep to a minimal set of fonts with clearly defined roles.
Thankfully, there has been several impressive open-source fonts released in the
last years, which made several combinations possible; in the end, we settled on
three families in Table~\ref{tab:fontRoles}, which are all packaged in the
\TeX{}live distribution.

The workhorse font is \hrefnote[--- SIL Open Font
License]{http://software.sil.org/gentium/}{Gentium}; it's compact, very legible,
and not as cold as the fonts we usually see in \LaTeX{} documents.
In titles, \hrefnote[--- Apache
License]{https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans}{Open Sans} gives a
neutral but friendly impression; it is not overpowering and is very legible in
small sizes, making it perfect for captions and page decorations.
Finally, the font for source code excerpts and verbatim text is \hrefnote[---
SIL Open Font License]{https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/}{Fira Mono}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Fonts used in the document, and their roles}
  \begin{fullwidthtabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    \textnormal{Gentium -- \textit{Italic}} & Primary, paragraph text \\
    \textsf{Open Sans -- \textbf{Bold}}     & Structural and secondary text: titles, captions \\
    \texttt{Fira Mono}                      & Verbatim text and code \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{fullwidthtabular}
  \label{tab:fontRoles}
\end{table}

\section{Source code and listings}

SBAbook provides custom high-level semantic markup for source code, which
relies on the powerful \code{listings} and \code{tcolorbox} packages.


\paragraph{Inline source code}
For short mentions of source code in the middle of the text, use the
\code§\code|...|§ macro.
This macro is an alias to \code§\lstinline§, which works like verbatim: it uses
an arbitrary delimiter.

Using this macro with curly braces like \code§\code{this}§ is possible, but this
is an experimental feature of \code{listings}, and it breaks in some cases; it's
fine when used in paragraph text, but things get weird as soon as it's part of
the argument of some other macro.
Table~\ref{tab:codeDelims} lists a few characters in the ASCII range that are
convenient as delimiters.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Some convenient delimiters for inline code}
  \begin{fullwidthtabular}{ll@{\qquad}ll}
    \toprule
    \code_\code|...|_ & pipe                      & \code¶\code§...§¶ & section sign \\
    \code|\code_..._| & underscore                & \code§\code¶...¶§ & pilcrow      \\
    \code¡\code!...!¡ & exclamation point         & \code~\code$...$~ & dollar sign  \\
    \code!\code¡...¡! & inverse exclamation point & \code$\code~...~$ & tilde        \\
    \code¿\code?...?¿ & question mark             & \code`\code^...^` & circumflex   \\
    \code?\code¿...¿? & inverse question mark     & \code^\code`...`^ & backquote    \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{fullwidthtabular}
  \label{tab:codeDelims}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Displayed source code}
For multi-line excerpts of source code that should appear in the flow of the
text, use the \code{displaycode} environment.
You have to specify the language each excerpt of code is written in, as an
argument; any language known to the \code{listings} package works.
Also, as that example shows, some extended characters are supported in source code, provided they are encoded in precomposed form.

\begin{displaycode}{[Visual]Basic}
10 PRINT "Hello SBAbook!"
20 PRINT "This is a paragraph-level listing."
25 PRINT "UTF-8: € Œuf cœur écrit en Français, izvršavanja, ελληνική γλώσσα, Здравствуй, мир!"
26 PRINT "ankaŭ vi povas skribi esperante: ĈĉĜĝĤĥĴĵŬŭ"
30 GOTO 10
\end{displaycode}


\paragraph{Referenced listings}
If you need a numbered source code listing that is referenced in the table of
contents, use the \code{listing} environment, providing a descriptive caption as
a second mandatory argument.
To reference that listing from the text, the label must be provided as
\code{label=something} in the optional argument, as in
listing~\ref{lst:fooNewWith} below.
Similarly, use the \code{list text} option from \code{tcolorbox} if the caption
should be worded differently in the table of contents.

\begin{listing}[label=lst:fooNewWith]{Smalltalk}
{A factory method in class \code{Foo}}
Foo class>>with: parameter
  ^ self new
    initializeWith: parameter
\end{listing}


\paragraph{Floating listings}
To make a floating listing, simply add the \code{float} option in the
environment's optional parameter.
In case you really need to specify the placement, the usual specifiers can also
be passed: \code{float=htbp}.
