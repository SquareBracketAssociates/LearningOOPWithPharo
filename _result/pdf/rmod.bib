@phdthesis{Abde09c,
	Abstract = {To cope with the complexity of large object-oriented software systems, developers organize classes into subsystems using the concepts of module or package. Such modular structure helps software systems to evolve when facing new requirements. The organization of classes into packages and/or subsystems represents the software modularization. the software modularization usually follows interrelationships between classes. Ideally, packages should to be loosely coupled and cohesive to a certain extent. However, Studies show that as
    software evolves to meet requirements and environment changes, the software modularization gradually drifts
    and looses quality. As a consequence, the software modularization must be maintained. It is thus important to
    understand, to assess and to optimize the organization of packages and their relationships.
    Our claim is that the maintenance of large and complex software modularizations needs approaches that help in:
    (1) understanding package shapes and relationships; (2) assessing the quality of a modularization, as well as
    the quality of a single package within a given modularization; (3) optimizing the quality of an existing
    modularization.
    In this thesis, we concentrate on three research fields: software visualizations, metrics and algorithms. At
    first, we define two visualizations that help maintainers: (1) to understand packages structure, usage and
    relationships; (2) to spot patterns; and (3) to identify misplaced classes and structural anomalies. In
    addition to visualizations, we define a suite of metrics that help in assessing the package design quality
    (i.e., package cohesion and coupling). We also define metrics that assess the quality of a collection of
    inter-dependent packages from different view points, such as the degree of package coupling and cycles.
    Finally, we define a search-based algorithm that automatically reduces package coupling and cycles only by
    moving classes over existing packages. Our optimization approach takes explicitly into account the original
    class organization and package structure. It also allows maintainers to control the optimization process by
    specifying: (1) the maximal number of classes that may change their packages; (2) the classes that are
    candidate for moving and the classes that should not; (3) the packages that are candidate for restructuring
    and the packages that should not; and (4) the maximal number of classes that a given package can entail.
    The approaches presented in this thesis have been applied to real large object-oriented software systems. The
    results we obtained demonstrate the usefulness of our visualizations and metrics; and the effectiveness of our
    optimization algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Context: Object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk, and C\+\+ structure their programs using packages. Maintainers of large systems need to understand how packages relate to each other, but this task is complex because packages often have multiple clients and play different roles (class container, code ownership. . . ). Several approaches have been proposed, among which the use of cohesion and coupling metrics. Such metrics help identify candidate packages for restructuring; however, they do not help maintainers actually understand the structure and interrelation- ships between packages.
Objectives: In this paper, we use pre-attentive processing as the basis for package visualization and see to what extent it could be used in package understanding.
Method: We present the package fingerprint, a 2D visualization of the references made to and from a package. The proposed visualization offers a semantically rich, but compact and zoomable views centered on packages. We focus on two views (incoming and outgoing references) that help users understand how the package under analysis is used by the system and how it uses the system.
Results: We applied these views on four large systems: Squeak, JBoss, Azureus, and ArgoUML. We obtained several interesting results, among which, the identification of a set of recurring visual patterns that help maintainers: (a) more easily identify the role of and the way a package is used within the system (e.g., the package under analysis provides a set of layered services), and, (b) detect either problematic situations (e.g., a single package that groups together a large number of basic services) or opportunities for better package restructuring (e.g., removing cyclic dependencies among packages). The visualization generally scaled well and the detection of different patterns was always possible.
Conclusion: The proposed visualizations and patterns proved to be useful in understanding and maintaining the different systems we addressed. To generalize to other contexts and systems, a real user study is required.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have largely investigated the detection of class design anomalies. They proposed a large set of metrics that help in detecting those anomalies and in predicting the quality of class design. While those studies and the proposed metrics are valuable, they do not address the particularities of Java interfaces. Interfaces define the contracts that spell out how software modules and logic units interact with each other. This paper proposes a list of design anomalies related to Java interfaces. We identify and describe those anomalies via real examples, taken from well-known Java applications. Then we define three metrics help in automatically estimate the interface design quality, regarding the proposed design anomalies. We evaluate our metrics on three large Java applications. The results show that our metrics are realistic and help in qualifying the interface design, and in identifying candidate refactoringRecently, there has been an important progress in applying search-based optimization techniques to the problem of software re-modularization. Yet, a major part of the existing body of work addresses the problem of modularizing software systems from scratch, regardless of the existing packages structure. This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization approach for improving existing packages structure. The optimization ap- proach aims at increasing the cohesion and reducing the coupling and cyclic connectivity of packages, by modifying as less as pos- sible the existing packages organization. Moreover, maintainers can specify several constraints to guide the optimization process with regard to extra design factors. To this contribution, we use the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). We evaluate the optimization approach through an experiment covering four real-world software systems. The results promise the effectiveness of our optimization approach for improving existing packages structure by doing very small modifications.},

While being an emblematic dynamic object-oriented language, Smalltalk is lagging behind in this regard. We report on the design, implementation and application of Gradualtalk, a gradually-typed Smalltalk meant to enable incremental typing of existing programs. The main design goal of the type system is to support the features of the Smalltalk language, like metaclasses and blocks, live programming, and to accomodate the programming idioms used in practice. We studied a number of existing projects in order to determine the features to include in the type system. As a result, Gradualtalk is a practical approach to gradual types in Smalltalk, with a novel blend of type system features that accomodate most programming idioms.},

One such algorithm, Concept Analysis, received a lot of interest recently. It creates a lattice of concepts, which have some advantages over the more traditional tree of clusters from clustering algorithms.We will argue that the main interest of Concept Analysis lies in the concepts themselves and can be disconnected from the particular structure (the lattice of concepts) in which the concepts are usually arranged. We will compare Concept Analysis to various other algorithms trying to select the most important concepts contained in a set of entities.Our main conclusion is that although it have advantages, the lattice of concepts suffer from a major drawback that other constructs do not have: it returns much more information (concepts) than what it was given in input (a set of entities describing some software system).},

	Abstract = {As valuable software systems become older, reverse engineering becomes increasingly important to companies that have to maintain the code. Clustering is a key activity in reverse engineering that is used to discover improved designs of systems or to extract significant concepts from code. Clustering is an old, highly sophisticated, activity which offers many methods to meet different needs. The various methods have been well documented in the past; however, conclusions from general clustering literature may not apply entirely to the reverse engineering domain. In the paper, the authors study three decisions that need to be made when clustering: the choice of (i) abstract descriptions of the entities to be clustered, (ii) metrics to compute coupling between the entities, and (iii) clustering algorithms. For each decision, our objective is to understand which choices are best when performing software remodularisation. The experiments were conducted on three public domain systems (gcc, Linux and Mosaic) and a real world legacy system (2 million LOC). Among other things, the authors confirm the importance of a proper description scheme for the entities being clustered, list a few effective coupling metrics and characterise the quality of different clustering algorithms. They also propose description schemes not directly based on the source code, and advocate better formal evaluation methods for the clustering results.},

We believe this approach is even more relevant when considering software maintenance where maintainers often have to modify a system that they did not develop, that has no documentation, and that nobody knows intimately. Contrasting with this lack of information on the system, maintainers need a lot of knowledge: about the application domain, the organization software maintenance procedures, the system itself, the language used, past development methods, etc. Although one can readily agree with the information needs listed above, there is no clear, exhaustive definition of which knowledge would be useful to perform software maintenance. In this paper we describe our research to identify these needs. This research is part of a long term project that aims at building a knowledge management system for software maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Creating and maintaining software systems is a knowledge intensive task. One needs to have a good understanding of the application domain, the problem to solve and all its requirements, the software process used, technical details of the programming language(s), the system's architecture and how the different parts fit together, how the system interacts with its environment, etc. All this knowledge is difficult and costly to gather. It is also difficult to store and usually lives only in the mind of the software engineers who worked on a particular project. If this is a problem for development of new software, it is even more for maintenance, when one must rediscover lost information of an abstract nature from legacy source code among a swarm of unrelated details. In this paper, we submit that this lack of knowledge is one of the prominent problems in software maintenance. To try to solve this problem, we adapted a knowledge extraction technique to the knowledge needs specific to software maintenance. We explain how we explicit the knowledge discovered on a legacy software during maintenance so that it may be recorded for future use. Some applications on industry maintenance projects are reported.},

	Abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering is a recent approach to software development where a set of software products are derived for a well defined target application domain, from a common set of core assets using analogous means of production (for instance, through Model Driven Engineering). Therefore, such family of products are built from reuse, instead of developed individually from scratch. SPL promise to lower the costs of development, increase the quality of software, give clients more flexibility and reduce time to market. These benefits come with a set of new problems and turn some older problems possibly more complex. One of these problems is traceability management. In the European AMPLE project we are creating a common traceability framework across the various activities of the SPL development. We identified four orthogonal traceability dimensions in SPL development, one of which is an extension of what is often considered as "traceability of variability". This constitutes one of the two contributions of this paper. The second contribution is the specification of a metamodel for a repository of traceability links in the context of SPL and the implementation of a respective traceability framework. This framework enables fundamental traceability management operations, such as trace import and export, modification, query and visualization. The power of our framework is highlighted with an example scenario.},

	Abstract = {Software re-modularization is an old preoccupation of reverse engineering research. The advantages of a well structured or modularized system are well known. Yet after so much time and efforts, the field seems unable to come up with solutions that make a clear difference in practice. Recently, some researchers started to question whether some basic assumptions of the field were not overrated. The main one consists in evaluating the high-cohesion/low-coupling dogma with metrics of unknown relevance. In this paper, we study a real structuring case (on the Eclipse platform) to try to better understand if (some) existing metrics would have helped the software engineers in the task. Results show that the cohesion and coupling metrics used in the experiment did not behave as expected and would probably not have helped the maintainers reach there goal.
We also measured another possible restructuring which is to decrease the number of cyclic dependencies between modules.
Again, the results did not meet expectations.},

	Abstract = {Reverse engineering is a difficult task even for humans. When trying to provide tools to assist in this task, one should try to take advantage of all possible sources of information.Informal sources, like naming conventions, are more abstract than the code, thus helping to bridge the gap between code and design. On the other hand, there is no certainty that they actually represent the current state of the system.Some researchers have used these informal sources of information, relying on an assumption that if types (or variables, or functions) have the same name then they represent the same thing.However none of these researchers have actually tried to establish to what extent this assumption is valid. This paper provides a framework to study this issue. We will define what it means to have a "reliable naming convention", how this can be tested and under what conditions.

Most of the research in this domain considers the body of the source code; trying to cluster together files which are conceptually related. This paper discusses techniques for extracting concepts (we call them ``abbreviations'') from a more informal source of information: file names. The task is difficult because nothing indicates where to split the file names into substrings. In general, finding abbreviations would require domain knowledge to identify the concepts that are referred to in a name and intuition to recognize such concepts in abbreviated forms.

For example, inheritance has been proved to convey two different meanings depending on whether it is behavior or implementation that is inherited. Another conceptually simple notion, multiple inheritance, has not yet been clearly formalized. In this paper, we start by looking at relationships between sibling classes (two immediate subclasses of a common parent). Siblings can be combined through multiple inheritance, or on the contrary, they can be mutually exclusive. We call the relation between incompatible siblings "opposition", and show how it could help in formalizing object models. We then consider widening the explicit use of negation in object models. We argue that negative assertions could be used to validate the creation of new classes to ensure they are compatible with the intended uses of existing classes. Negation leads us to consider the implicit assumption behind object models, we propose to shift from the closed world assumption to the open world assumption.},

	Abstract = {As valuable software systems get old, reverse engineering becomes more and more important to the companies that have to maintain the code. Clustering is a key activity in reverse engineering to discover a better design of the systems or to extract significant concepts from the code. Clustering is an old activity, highly sophisticated, offering many methods to answer different needs. Although these methods have been well documented in the past, these discussions may not apply entirely to the reverse engineering domain. We study some clustering algorithms and other parameters to establish whether and why they could be used for software remodularization. We study three aspects of the clustering activity: abstract descriptions chosen for the entities to cluster; metrics computing coupling between the entities; and clustering algorithms. The experiments were conducted on three public domain systems (gcc, Linux and Mosaic) and a real world legacy system (2 million LOC). Among other things, we confirm the importance of a proper description scheme of the entities being clustered, we list a few good coupling metrics to use and characterize the quality of different clustering algorithms. We also propose novel description schemes not directly based on the source code and we advocate better formal evaluation methods for the clustering results},

	Abstract = {We discuss how to extract a useful set of subsystems from a set of existing source-code file names. This problem is challenging because many legacy systems use thousands of files names, including some that are very short and cryptic. At the same time the problem is important because software maintainers often find it difficult to understand such systems. We propose a general algorithm to cluster files based on their names, and a set of alternative methods for implementing the algorithm. One of the key tasks is picking candidate words to try to identify in file names. We do this by (a) iteratively decomposing file names, (b) finding common substrings, and (c) choosing words in routine names, in an English dictionary or in source-code comments. In addition, we investigate generating abbreviations from the candidate words in order to find matches in file names, as well as how to split file names into components given no word markers. To compare and evaluate our five approaches, we present two experiments. The first compares the "concepts" found in each file name by each method with the results of manually decomposing file names. The second experiment compares automatically generated subsystems with subsystem examples proposed by experts. We conclude that two methods are most effective: extracting concepts using common substrings and extracting those concepts that relate to the names of routines in the files.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented applications are difficult to extend and maintain, due to the presence of implicit dependencies in the inheritance hierarchy. Although these dependencies of- ten correspond to well-known schemas, such as hook and template methods, new unanticipated dependency schemas occur in practice, and can consequently be hard to recognize and detect. To tackle this problem, we have applied Concept Analysis to automatically detect recurring dependency schemas in class hierarchies used in object-oriented applications. In this paper we describe our mapping of OO dependencies to the formal framework of Concept Analysis, we apply our approach to a non-trivial case study, and we report on the kinds of dependencies that are uncovered with this technique. As a result, we show how the discovered dependency schemas correspond not only to good design practices, but also to "bad smells" in design.},

	Abstract = {Supporting read-only and side effect free execution has been the focus of a large body of work in the area of statically typed programming languages. Read-onlyness in dynamically typed languages is difficult to achieve because of the absence of a type checking phase and the support of an open-world assumption in which code can be constantly added and modified. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Read-Only references (DRO) that provide a view on an object where this object and its object graph are protected from modification. The read- only view dynamically propagates to aggregated objects, without changing the object graph itself; it acts as a read-only view of complex data structures, without making them read-only globally. We implement dynamic read-only references by using smart object proxies that lazily propagate the read-only view, following the object graph and driven by control flow and applied them to realize side-effect free assertions.},

	Abstract = {Dynamically-typed object-oriented programming languages do not provide type information until runtime. Two of their main advantages are that they allow fast prototyping and integrating changes at runtime. The ability of dynamically-typed languages to support program changes at runtime and the lack of type information doom the classic security approaches to failure. Controlling references to single objects and to graphs of objects is essential to build secure systems. Existing approaches are commonly based on static type system and cannot be applied to dynamically-typed languages.This thesis argue that: In the context of dynamically-typed languages, reifying references, controlling behavior, and isolating state via such references, is a practical way to control references. This thesis makes five contributions: - We propose dynamic read-only objects (DRO) as one kind of adaptation of behavioral change at reference-level. - We generalize the DRO model to enable more generic behavioral changes. We extend the Pharo programming environment and language with Handles, that are first-class references with the ability to change the behavior of referenced objects. - We define Metahandle to offer flexibility and adaptability to controlled references. - We propose SHandle, an extension of the Handle model to isolate side effects at the level of references. - And finally, we formalize the Handles and SHandle models to represent and explain their semantics. As validation of our thesis we have implemented three approaches  relevant to securing system using our model. In addition, as proof of concept we extended the Pharo virtual machine to support Handles, Metahandles and SHandles.},

	Abstract = {Controlling object graphs and giving specific semantics to references (such as read-only, owner- ship, scoped sharing) has been the focus of a large body of research in the context of static type systems. Controlling references to single objects and to graphs of objects is essential to build more secure systems, but is notoriously hard to achieve in absence of static type systems. In this article we embrace this challenge by proposing a solution to the following question: What is an underlying mechanism that can support the definition of properties (such as revocable, read-only, lent) at the reference level in the absence of a static type system? We present handles: first-class references that propagate behavioral change dynamically to the object subgraph during program execution. In this article we describe handles and show how handles support the implementa- tion of read-only references and revocable references. Handles have been fully implemented by modifying an existing virtual machine and we report their costs.},

	Abstract = {The Pharo Smalltalk-inspired language and environment started its development with a codebase that can be traced back to the original
	Smalltalk-80 release from 1983. Over the last years, Pharo has been used as the basis of many research projects. Often these experiments needed
	changes related to the compiler infrastructure. However, they did not use the existing compiler and instead implemented their own experimental solutions.
	This shows that despite being an impressive achievement considering its age of over 35 years, the compiler infrastructure needs to be improved.
	We identify three problems: (i) The architecture is not reusable, (ii) compiler  can not be parametrized and (iii) the mapping between source code
	and bytecode is overly complex.

	Abstract ={Speculative inlining in just-in-time compilers enables many performance optimizations. However, it also introduces significant complexity. The compiler optimizations themselves, as well as the deoptimization mechanism are complex and error prone. To stabilize our bytecode to bytecode just-in-time compiler, we designed a new approach to validate the correctness of dynamic deoptimization. The approach consists of the symbolic execution of an optimized and an unop-timized bytecode compiled method side by side, deoptimizing the abstract stack at each deoptimization point (where dynamic deoptimization is possible) and comparing the deoptimized and unoptimized abstract stack to detect bugs. The implementation of our approach generated tests for several hundred thousands of methods, which are now available to be run automatically after each commit.},

Refactoring to eliminate these anomalies may not be an option, at least in certain stages of software evolution.  Classboxes are modules that restrict the visibility of changes to selected clients only, thereby offering more freedom in the way unanticipated changes may be implemented, and thus reducing the need for convoluted design anomalies. In this paper we demonstrate how classboxes can be implemented in statically-typed languages like {Java}. We also present an extended case study of Swing, a {Java} GUI package built on top of AWT, and we document the ensuing anomalies that Swing introduces. We show how Classbox/J, a prototype implementation of classboxes for {Java}, is used to provide a cleaner implementation of Swing using local refinement rather than subclassing.},

mechanisms to bundle interacting classes (i.e., packages, modules, selector namespaces,

foundation is needed. As far as we are aware of, no major attempt that would go in that
direction has been realized. In this paper we present a simple module calculus together
with a set of operators for modeling the composition semantics of different grouping
mechanisms. Using this module calculus we are able to express the semantics of {Java}

families sharing similar characteristics. In addition it provides a uniform way to

support the reuse of method collections over several classes. However, traits cannot be
used when specifying unanticipated changes to an application. On the other hand, classboxes
are a new module system that supports the local redefinition of classes: a collection of
classes can be locally extended with variables and/or methods and the existing clients do
not get impacted by changes. However, an extension applied to a class by a classbox cannot
be reused for other classes. This paper describes how combining Traits and Classboxes
supports the safe introduction of crosscutting collaborations: safe because the existing
clients of the classes do not get impacted, crosscutting because collaborations between
several classes can be put in place in a unanticipated manner. In the resulting system, a
collaboration is represented by a classbox and a role by a trait.},

In addition, certain applications require that changes be applied dynamically without

classboxes to make them dynamic. A classbox is a kind of module that supports class
extension and instance variable addition. Class extensions and definitions defined in a
classbox represent an aspect. In addition, with classboxes, aspects are dynamically applied
to, removed from hot- in a system. Such aspects may crosscut a large number of classes
which are extended by adding or redefining existing methods and adding new instance
variables. Finally the aspects are scoped i.e., they are local to the classboxes that

focus on having methods as first class entities, enabling methods manipulation as plain

	Abstract = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose classes from reusable
components while avoiding problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance and mixins.
Traits as originally proposed are \emph{stateless}, that is, they contain only methods, but
no instance variables. State can only be accessed within traits by accessors, which become
\emph{required methods} of the trait. Although this approach works reasonably well in
practice, it means that many traits, viewed as software components, are artificially
\emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may contain significant amounts of
boilerplate glue code. Although these limitations are largely mitigated by proper tool
support, we seek a cleaner solution that supports \emph{stateful traits}. The key
difficulty is how to handle conflicts that arise when composed traits contribute instance
variables whose names clash. We present a solution that is faithful to the guiding
principle of stateless traits: \emph{the client retains control of the composition}.
Stateful traits consist of a minimal extension to stateless traits in which instance
variables are purely local to the scope of a trait, unless they are explicitly made
accessible by the composing client of a trait. Naming conflicts are avoided, and variables
of disjoint traits can be explicitly merged by clients. We discuss and compare two
implementation strategies, and briefly present a case study in which stateful traits have
been used to refactor the trait-based version of the Smalltalk collection hierarchy.},

	Abstract = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose classes from reusable components while avoiding problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance and mixins. Traits as originally proposed are stateless, that is, they contain only methods, but no instance variables. State can only be accessed within stateless traits by accessors, which become required methods of the trait. Although this approach works reasonably well in practice, it means that many traits, viewed as software components, are artificially \emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may contain significant amounts of boilerplate glue code. We present an approach to stateful traits that is faithful to the guiding principle of stateless traits: the client retains control of the composition. Stateful traits consist of a minimal extension to stateless traits in which instance variables are purely local to the scope of a trait, unless they are explicitly made accessible by the composing client of a trait. We demonstrate by means of a formal object calculus that adding state to traits preserves the flattening property: traits contained in a program can be compiled away. We discuss and compare two implementation strategies, and briefly present a case study in which stateful traits have been used to refactor the trait-based version of the Smalltalk collection hierarchy.},

@phdthesis{Bhat08d,
	Abstract = {In this dissertation, we present Procedural Object-Oriented Code (POC). POC is the aftermath of the software development activity that involves state of the art object-oriented languages, without employing object-oriented analysis and design. Huge classes, absence of abstractions for domain entities, and shallow inheritance hierarchies are hallmark design defects of procedural object-oriented code. POC also consists of scattered code appearing not only due to the absence of aspects, but it also manifests scattered code appearing due to the non-abstracted domain entities i.e., domain entities that do not have their proper object-oriented classes. The non-abstracted domain logic hinders mining useful crosscutting concerns related to aspects in POC. Confronted with the absence of object-oriented design and the difficulty of mining aspects in POC, we studied it from two perspectives.
	First, we improve aspect mining techniques by classifying various crosscutting concerns identified in POC with a two-pronged approach: Firstly, the approach identifies and groups crosscutting concerns present in a software system: aspects as well as non-abstracted domain logic. Crosscutting concerns pertaining to non- abstracted domain entities are identified and extracted through their usage of application domain entity data. Secondly, a new metric called spread-out is introduced to quantify the divulgence of diverse crosscutting concerns.
	Second, we studied the problem of object identification in procedural object- oriented code. We present a semi-automatic, tool-assisted approach for restructuring POC into an improved object-oriented design. The approach identifies principal classes in POC. These principal classes are then used to extract object-oriented abstractions using Formal Concept Analysis lattices. This is achieved by providing three different concept lattices, namely fundamental, association, and interactions views.
	We developed tools to validate the approaches presented in the thesis. The approaches are validated on a recently developed industrial application. The application is used to run blood plasma analysis automatons. The results of our approach are promising.},

	Abstract = {Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) provides an important approach in software reengineering for software understanding,  design anomalies detection and correction.
However, FCA-based approaches  have two problems: (i) they produce lattices that must be interpreted by the user according to his/her understanding of the technique and different elements of the graph; and, (ii) the lattice can rapidly become so big that one is overwhelmed by the mass of information and possibilities.
In this paper, we present  a catalog of important patterns in concept lattices, which can allow automating the task of lattice interpretation. The approach helps the reengineer to concentrate on the task of reengineering rather than understanding a complex lattice.
We provide interpretation of these patterns in a generalized manner and illustrate them on various contexts constructed from program information of different open-source systems. We also present a tool that allows automated extraction of the patterns from concept lattices.

	abstract={Automatic testing constitutes an important part of everyday development practice. Worldline, a major IT company, is creating more and more tests to ensure the good behavior of its applications and gains in efficiency and quality. But running all these tests may take hours. This is especially true for large systems involving, for example, the deployment of a web server or communication with a database. For this reason, tests are not launched as often as they should be and are mostly run at night. The company wishes to improve its development and testing process by giving to developers rapid feedback after a change. An interesting solution is to reduce the number of tests to run by identifying only those exercising the piece of code changed. Two main approaches are proposed in the literature: static and dynamic. The static approach creates a model of the source code and explores it to find links between changed methods and tests. The dynamic approach records invocations of methods during the execution of test scenarios. Before deploying a test case selection solution, Worldline created a partnership with us to investigate the situation in its projects and to evaluate these approaches on three industrial, closed source, cases to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each solution. We propose a classification of problems that may arise when trying to identify the tests that cover a method. We give concrete examples of these problems and list some possible solutions. We also evaluate other issues such as the impact on the results of the frequency of modification of methods or considering groups of methods instead of single ones. We found that solutions must be combined to obtain better results, and problems have different impacts on projects. Considering commits instead of individual methods tends to worsen the results, perhaps due to their large size.},

	Abstract = {A trait is a programming construct which provides code reusability. Traits are groups of methods that can be reused orthogonally from inheritance. Traits offer a solution to the problems of multiple inheritance by providing a behavior-centric modularity. Since traits offer an alternative to traditional inheritance-based code reuse, a couple of questions arise. For example, what is a good granularity for a Trait enabling reuse as well as plug ease? How much reuse can we expect on large existing inheritance-based hierarchies?
In this paper we take as case study the Smalltalk Collection hierarchy and we start rewriting it from scratch using traits from the beginning. We show how such library can be built using traits and we report such a preliminary experience. Since the Collection library is large, we focused and built the main classes of the library with Traits and report problems we encountered and how we solved them. Results of this experience are positive and show that we can build new collections based on the traits used to define the new library kernel.},

	Abstract = {Virtual machines emulating hardware devices are generally implemented in low-level languages and using a low-level style for performance reasons.  This trend results in largely difficult to understand, difficult to extend and unmaintainable systems. As new general techniques for virtual machines arise, it gets harder to incorporate or test these techniques because of early design and optimization decisions. In this paper we show how such decisions can be postponed to later phases by separating virtual machine implementation issues from the high-level machine-specific model. We construct compact models of whole-system VMs in a high-level language, which exclude all low-level implementation details. We use the pluggable translation toolchain PyPy to translate those models to executables. During the translation process, the toolchain reintroduces the VM implementation and optimization details for specific target platforms.  As a case study we implement an executable model of a hardware gaming device. We show that our approach to VM building increases understandability, maintainability and extendability while preserving performance.},

With FFIs the high-level environment interacts with low-level functions allowing for a unique combination of features. This duality has a strong impact on the implementation of the FFI: it has to be flexible and fast at the same time.
	We propose NativeBoost a language-side approach to FFIs that only requires minimal changes to the VM. NativeBoost directly creates specific native code at language-side and thus combines the flexibility of a language-side library with the performance of a native plugin.},

	Abstract = {The goal of high-level low-level programming is to bring the abstraction capabilities of high-level languages to the system programming domain, such as virtual machines (VMs) and language runtimes. However, existing solutions are bound to compilation time and expose limited possibilities to be changed at runtime and from language-side. They do not fit well with fully reflective languages and environments.
We propose Benzo1, a lightweight framework for high- level low-level programming that allows developers to gen- erate and execute at runtime low-level code (assembly). It promotes the implementation, and dynamic modification, of system components with high-level language tools outper- forming existing dynamic solutions.
Since Benzo is a general framework we choose three ap- plications that cover an important range of the spectrum of system programming for validating the infrastructure: a For- eign Function Interface (FFI), primitives instrumentation and a just-in-time bytecode compiler (JIT). With Benzo we show that these typical VM-level components are feasible as reflective language-side implementations. Due to its unique combination of high-level reflection and low-level program- ming, Benzo shows better performance for these three ap- plications than the comparable high-level implementations.},

	abstract = {High-level languages implement reflection which allows a language runtime to inspect and alter its own execution and state. These high-level languages typically run on top of virtual machines (vms) which have been built to create an abstraction layer over hardware. Due to the isolating nature of the vm, reflection is generally limited to the language-side. Several research vms overcome this separation and provide a unified model where there is no more a clear distinction between language-side and vm-side. In such a language runtime it is possible to reflectively modify vm components from language-side as they reside on the same abstraction layer. In this dissertation we follow the same global direction towards a unified language-runtime or self-aware vm. However, instead of looking for a holistic solution we focus on a minimal approach. Instead of using a custom tailored language runtime we use dynamic native code activation from language-side on top of an existing vm. We first present Benzo our framework for dynamic native code activation. Benzo provides a generic but low-level interface to the vm internals. Based on this framework we then evaluate several applications that typically require direct vm support. We show first how Benzo is used to build an efficient ffi interface, allowing for a more structured access to vm internal functions. To evaluate the limitations of Benzo we target two more applications: dynamic primitives and a language-side jit compiler. Both of them require a tight interaction with the underlying vm.},

Unfortunately, since such a system is at both ends of a causal loop, this means modifications that impact the reflective layer itself can be overly difficult to apply.  This paper introduces ObjectSpaces, a reification of the familiar Smalltalk image as a first-class entity. By confining the system inside an ObjectSpace, we isolate the evolution tools from it, while still giving them reflective access to the confined system.  We describe the ObjectSpaces idea, the interface to communicate, inspect, and debug objects contained inside and ObjectSpace, based on a prototype implementation in GNU Smalltalk.},

	Abstract = {Smalltalk is a reflective system. It means that it is defined in itself in a causally connected way. Traditionally, Smalltalk systems evolved by modifying and cloning what is called an image (a chunk of memory containing all the objects at a given point in time). During the evolution of the system, objects representing it are modified. However, such an image modification and cloning poses several problems: (1) There is no operational machine-executable algorithm that allows one to build a system from scratch. A system object may be modified but it may be difficult to reproduce its exact state before the changes. Therefore it is difficult to get a reproducible process. (2) As a consequence, certain classes may not have been initialized since years. (3) Finally, since the system acts as a living system, it is not simple to evolve the kernel for introducing new abstractions without performing some kind of brain surgery on oneself. There is a need to have a step by step process to build Smalltalk kernels from scratch. In this paper, after an analysis of past and current practices to mutate or generate kernels, we describe a kernel bootstrap process step-by-step. First the illusion of the existence of a kernel is created via stubs objects. Second the classes and meta-classes hierarchy are generated. Code is compiled and finally information needed by the virtual machine and execution are generated and installed.},

	Abstract = {Recent years saw the development of a composition
                  mechanism called Traits. Traits are pure units of
                  behavior that can be composed to form classes or
                  other traits. The trait composition mechanism is an
                  alternative to multiple or mixin inheritance in
                  which the composer has full control over the trait
                  composition. To evaluate the expressiveness of
                  traits, some hierarchies were refactored, showing
                  code reuse. However, such large refactorings, while
                  valuable, may not exhibit all possible composition
                  problems, since the hierarchies were previously
                  expressed using single inheritance and following
                  certain patterns. This paper presents our work on
                  designing and implementing a new trait-based stream
                  library named Nile. It evaluates how far traits
                  enable reuse, what problems can be encountered when
                  building a library using traits from scratch and
                  compares the traits solution to alternative
                  composition mechanisms. Nile's core allows the
                  definition of compact collection and file streaming
                  libraries as well as the implementation of a
                  backward-compatible new stream library. Nile method
                  size shows a reduction of 40\% compared to the Squeak
                  equivalent. The possibility to reuse the same set of
                  traits to implement two distinct libraries is a
                  concrete illustration of trait reuse capability.},

                  providing programming, execution and simulation
                  support dedicated to the pervasive computing domain.
                  This approach relies on a domain-specific language,
                  named DiaSpec, dedicated to the description of
                  pervasive computing systems. Our generative approach
                  factors out features of distributed systems
                  technologies, making DiaSpec-specified software
                  systems portable. The DiaSpec compiler is
                  implemented and has been used to generate dedicated
                  programming frameworks for a variety of pervasive
                  computing applications, including detailed ones to
                  manage the building of an engineering school.},

	Abstract = {A software architecture describes the structure of a
                  computing system by specifying software components
                  and their interactions. Mapping a software
                  architecture to an implementation is a well known
                  challenge. A key element of this mapping is the
                  architecture's description of the data and
                  control-flow interactions between components. The
                  characterization of these interactions can be rather
                  abstract or very concrete, providing more or less
                  implementation guidance, programming support, and
                  static verification. In this paper, we explore one
                  point in the design space between abstract and
                  concrete component interaction specifications. We
                  introduce a notion of interaction contract that
                  expresses allowed interactions between components,
                  describing both data and control-flow constraints.
                  This declaration is part of the architecture
                  description, allows generation of extensive
                  programming support, and enables various
                  verifications. We instantiate our approach in an
                  architecture description language for
                  Sense/Compute/Control applications, and describe
                  associated compilation and verification strategies.},

	Abstract = {A Sense/Compute/Control (SCC) application is one
                  that interacts with the physical environment. Such
                  applications are pervasive in domains such as
                  building automation, assisted living, and autonomic
                  computing. Developing an SCC application is complex
                  because: (1) the implementation must address both
                  the interaction with the environment and the
                  application logic; (2) any evolution in the
                  environment must be reflected in the implementation
                  of the application; (3) correctness is essential, as
                  effects on the physical environment can have
                  irreversible consequences. The SCC architectural
                  pattern and the DiaSpec domain-specific design
                  language propose a framework to guide the design of
                  such applications. From a design description in
                  DiaSpec, the DiaSpec compiler is capable of
                  generating a programming framework that guides the
                  developer in implementing the design and that
                  provides ru=ntime support. In this paper, we report
                  on an experiment using DiaSpec (both the design
                  language and compiler) to develop a standard
                  robotics application. We discuss the benefits and
                  problems of using DiaSpec in a robotics setting
                  and present some changes that would make DiaSpec
                  a better framework in this setting.},

	Abstract = {Isolating programs is an important mechanism to
                  support more secure applications. Isolating program
                  in dynamic languages such as JavaScript is even more
                  challenging since reflective operations can
                  circumvent simple mechanisms that could protect
                  program parts. In this article we present SafeJS, an
                  approach and implementation that offers isolation
                  based on separate sandboxes and control of
                  information exchanged between them. In SafeJS,
                  sandboxes based on web workers do not share any
                  data. Data exchanged between sandboxes is solely
                  based on strings. Using different policies, this
                  infrastructure supports the isolation of the
                  different scripts that usually populate web pages. A
                  foreign component cannot modify the main DOM tree in
                  unexpected manner. Our SafeJS implementation is

	Abstract = {{Modern languages are typically supported by managed runtimes (Virtual Machines). Since VMs have to deal with many concepts such as memory management, abstract execution model and scheduling, they tend to be very complex. Additionally, VMs have to meet strong performance requirements. This demand of performance is one of the main reasons why many VMs are built statically. Thus, design decisions are frozen at compile time preventing changes at runtime. One clear example is the impossibility to dynamically adapt or change primitives of the VM once it has been compiled. In this work we present a toolchain that allows for altering and configuring components such as primitives and plug-ins at runtime. The main contribution is Waterfall, a dynamic and reflective translator from Slang, a restricted subset of Smalltalk, to native code. Waterfall generates primitives on demand and executes them on the fly. We validate our approach by implementing dynamic primitive modification and runtime customization of VM plug-ins.}},

	Abstract = {Modern development environments promote live programming (LP) mechanisms because it enhances the development experience by providing instantaneous feedback and interaction with live objects. LP is typically supported with advanced reflective techniques within dynamic languages. These languages run on top of Virtual Machines (VMs) that are built in a static manner so that most of their components are bound at compile time. As a consequence, VM developers are forced to work using the traditional edit-compile-run cycle, even when they are designing LP-supporting environments. In this paper we explore the idea of bringing LP techniques to VM development to improve the observabil-ity, evolution and adaptability of VMs at run-time. We define the notion of fully reflective execution environments , systems that provide reflection not only at the application level but also at the level of the execution environment (EE). We characterize such systems, propose a design, and present Mate v1, a prototypical implementation. Based on our prototype, we analyze the feasibility and applicability of incorporating reflective capabilities into different parts of EEs. Furthermore, the evaluation demonstrates the opportunities such reflective capabilities provide for unanticipated dynamic adaptation scenarios, benefiting thus, a wider range of users.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the run-time behavior of software systems can be a challenging activity. Debuggers are an essential category of tools used for this purpose as they give developers direct access to the running systems. Nevertheless, traditional debuggers rely on generic mechanisms to introspect and interact with the running systems, while developers reason about and formulate domain-specific questions using concepts and abstractions from their application domains. This mismatch creates an abstraction gap between the debugging needs and the debugging support leading to an inefficient and error-prone debugging effort, as developers need to recover concrete domain concepts using generic mechanisms. To reduce this gap, and increase the efficiency of the debugging process, we propose a framework for developing domain-specific debuggers, called the Moldable Debugger, that enables debugging at the level of the application domain. The Moldable Debugger is adapted to a domain by creating and combining domain-specific debugging operations with domain-specific debugging views, and adapts itself to a domain by selecting, at run time, appropriate debugging operations and views. To ensure the proposed model has practical applicability (i.e., can be used in practice to build real debuggers), we discuss, from both a performance and usability point of view, three implementation strategies. We further motivate the need for domain-specific debugging, identify a set of key requirements and show how our approach improves debugging by adapting the debugger to several domains.},

	Abstract = {Abstract-Bug prediction is an important challenge for software engineering research. It consist in looking for possible early indicators of the presence of bugs in a software. However, despite the relevance of the issue, most experiments designed to evaluate bug prediction only investigate whether there is a linear relation between the predictor and the presence of bugs. However, it is well known that standard regression models can not filter out spurious relations. Therefore, in this paper we describe an experiment to discover more robust evidences towards causality between software metrics (as predictors) and the occurrence of bugs. For this purpose, we have relied on Granger Causality Test to evaluate whether past changes in a given time series are useful to forecast changes in another series. As its name suggests, Granger Test is a better indication of causality between two variables. We present and discuss the results of experiments on four real world systems evaluated over a time frame of almost four years. Particularly, we have been able to discover in the history of metrics the causes --- in the terms of the Granger Test --- for 64\% to 93\% of the defects reported for the systems considered in our experiment.},

This is a problem because coordination is often buried in the code of the coordinated objects, leading to a lack of abstraction and reuse. Here we present CoLaS, a coordination model and its implementation based on the notion of Coordination Groups. By clearly identifying and separating the coordination from the co-ordinated objects CoLaS provides a better abstraction and reuse of the coordination and the coordinated objects. Moreover CoLaS's high dynamicity provides better support for coordination of active objects.},

The main problem is that the description of the elements from which systems are built, and the way in which they are composed are mixed into the application code.

However, these extensions introduce complexity and have not yet been combined to simultaneously add both state and visibility control to traits.
This paper revisits the addition of state and visibility control to traits. Rather than extending the original traits model with additional operations, we allow traits to be lexically nested within other modules. Traits can then have (shared) state and visibility control by hiding variables or methods in their lexical scope.

	Abstract = {The actor model is a message-passing concurrency model that avoids
deadlocks and low-level data races by construction. This facilitates concurrent
programming, especially in the context of complex interactive applications
where modularity, security and fault-tolerance are required. The tradeoff is
that the actor model sacrifices expressiveness and safety guarantees with
respect to parallel access to shared state. In this paper we present domains as
a set of novel language abstractions for safely encapsulating and sharing state
within the actor model. We introduce four types of domains, namely immutable,
isolated, observable and shared domains that each are tailored to a certain
access pattern on that shared state. The domains are characterized with an
operational semantics. For each we discuss how the actor model's safety
guarantees are upheld even in the presence of conceptually shared state.
Furthermore, the proposed language abstractions are evaluated with a case study
in Scala comparing them to other synchonisation mechanisms to demonstrate their
benefits in deadlock freedom, parallel reads, and enforced isolation.},

	Abstract = {Now that multicore processors are commonplace, developing parallel software has escaped the confines of high-performance computing and enters the mainstream. The Fork/Join framework, for instance, is part of the standard Java platform since version 7. Fork/Join is a high-level parallel programming model advocated to make parallelizing recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms particularly easy. While, in theory, Fork/Join is a simple and effective technique to expose parallelism in applications, it has not been investigated before whether and how the technique is applied in practice. We therefore performed an empirical study on a corpus of 120 open source Java projects that use the framework for roughly 362 different tasks.
On the one hand, we confirm the frequent use of four best-practice patterns (Sequential Cutoff, Linked Subtasks, Leaf Tasks, and avoiding unnecessary forking) in actual projects. On the other hand, we also discovered three recurring anti-patterns that potentially limit parallel performance: sub-optimal use of Java collections when splitting tasks into subtasks as well as when merging the results of subtasks, and finally the inappropriate sharing of resources between tasks. We document these anti-patterns and study their impact on performance.},

Just-in-Time Data Structures are an attempt to shift the focus from finding the right data structure to finding the right sequence of data representations.

	Abstract = {The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model is a parallel programming model that aims to improve programmer productivity while at the same time aiming for high performance. The main premise of PGAS is that a globally shared address space improves productivity, but that a distinction between local and remote data accesses is required to allow performance optimizations and to support scalability on large-scale parallel architectures. To this end, PGAS preserves the global address space while embracing awareness of non-uniform communication costs.
Today, about a dozen languages exist that adhere to the PGAS model. This survey proposes a definition and a taxonomy along four axes: how parallelism is introduced, how the address space is partitioned, how data is distributed among the partitions and finally how data is accessed across partitions. Our taxonomy reveals that today's PGAS languages focus on distributing regular data and distinguish only between local and remote data access cost, whereas the distribution of irregular data and the adoption of richer data access cost models remain open challenges.},

Reverse engineering is an integral part of any successful software system, because changing requirements lead to implementations that drift from their original design. In contrast to traditional reverse engineering techniques -which analyse a single snapshot of a system- we focus the reverse engineering effort by determining where the implementation has changed. Since changes of object-oriented software are often phrased in terms of refactorings, we propose a set of heuristics for detecting refactorings by applying lightweight, object-oriented metrics to successive versions of a software system. We validate our approach with three separate case studies of mature object-oriented software systems for which multiple versions are available. The case studies suggest that the heuristics support the reverse engineering process by focusing attention on the relevant parts of a software system.},

	Abstract = {The notion of refactoring --- transforming the source-code of an object-oriented program without changing its external behaviour --- has been studied intensively within the last decade. This diversity has created a plethora of toy-examples, cases and code snippets, which make it hard to assess the current state-of-the-art.  Moreover, due to this diversity, there is currently no accepted way of teaching good refactoring practices, despite the acknowledgment in the software engineering body of knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents a common example --- the LAN simulation --- which has been used by a number of European Universities for both research and teaching purposes.},

The industrial partners in the FAMOOS project have learned this lesson the hard way: they are now faced with large and rigid software systems that hamper them in meeting a diverse and evolving set of customer requirements. Object-oriented frameworks are touted as a promising solution, but it is unclear how to transform object-oriented legacy systems into frameworks. This paper proposes an approach --i.e, a methodology and tools-- for re-engineering object-oriented systems towards frameworks by means of high-level and low-level restructuring transformations that detect and resolve architectural and detailed design anomalies, and improve application flexibility and adaptability.},

Meanwhile, our argumentation includes a number of constructive suggestions that we ho pe will influence future releases of the UML and MOF standards.},

Since the only way to achieve a truly reusable object-oriented design is recognised to be iterative development, reverse engineering is indeed an essential facet of any object-oriented development process. The pattern language itself covers the different phases one encounters when reverse engineering a large software system: from being unfamiliar with a software system up untill preparations for actual reengineering. What you read here is a short version of a complete pattern language. We present only five patterns in full detail and include a summary for the remaining patterns.},

We propose a single, compact view of all class hierarchies at once using a custom Sunburst layout. It enables to quickly discover interesting facts across classes while preserving the essential relationship between parent and children classes. We explain how standard inheritance metrics are mapped into our visualization. Additionally, we define a new metric characterizing similar children classes. Using these metrics and the proposed layout, a set of common visual patterns is derived.  These patterns allow the programmer to quickly understand how inheritance is used and provide answers to some essential questions when performing program comprehension tasks. Our approach is evaluated through a case study that involves examples from large programs, demonstrating its scalability.},

Squeak is available on the internet under a free license, it is highly portable and currently used on over 20 different platforms. This talk will give an overview over the Squeak Project: From the eToy kids programming environment up to the Seaside system for professional web development. The eToys make programming fun for children from around age 8. The talk will show how to build simple eToy programs and how Squeak is used at school. But even professional developers are using Squeak; The Seaside framework shows how the openness of Squeak can help to make developers more productive. The last part of the talk will give a glimpse into the future: OpenCroquet. The Croquet project is building a revolutionary collaborative environment based on Squeak.

	Abstract = {The developers of tools for dynamic analysis are faced with choosing from the many approaches to gathering runtime data. Typically, dynamic analysis involves instrumenting the program under investigation to record its runtime behavior.  Current approaches for byte-code based systems like Java and Smalltalk rely often on inserting byte-code into the program under analysis. However, detailed knowledge of the target programming language or virtual machine is required to implement dynamic analysis tools. Obtaining and exploiting this knowledge to build better analysis tools is cumbersome and often distracts the tool builder from the actual goal, which is the analysis of the runtime behavior of a system. In this paper, we argue that we need to adopt a higher level view of a software system when considering the task of abstracting runtime information. We focus on object-oriented virtual machine based languages. We want to be able to deal with the runtime system as a collection of reified first-class entities. We propose to achieve this by introducing a layer of abstraction, i.e., a behavioral middle layer. This has the advantage that the task of collecting dynamic information is not concerned with low level details of a specific language or virtual machine.  The positive effect of such a behavioral middle layer is twofold: on the one hand it provides us with a standard API for all dynamic analysis based tools to use, on the other hand it allows the tool developer to abstract from the actual implementation technique.},

However, the granularity of structural reflection stops at the method level.  This is a problem since without sub-method reflection developers have to duplicate efforts, for example to introduce transparently pluggable type-checkers or fine-grained profilers. In this paper we present Persephone, an efficient implementation of a sub-method meta-object protocol (MOP) based on AST annotations and dual methods (a compiled method and its meta-object) that reconcile AST expressiveness with bytecode execution. We validate the MOP by presenting TreeNurse, a method instrumentation framework and TypePlug, an optional, pluggable type system which is based on Persephone.},

	Abstract = {Real world software systems change continuously to meet new demands. Most programming languages and development environments, however, are more concerned with limiting the effects of change rather than enabling and exploiting change. Various techniques and technologies to exploit change have been developed over the years, but there exists no common support for these approaches. We propose Changeboxes as a general-purpose mechanism for encapsulating change as a first-class entity in a running software system. Changeboxes support multiple, concurrent and possibly inconsistent views of software artifacts within the same running system.  Since Changeboxes are first-class, they can be manipulated to control the scope of change in a running system.Furthermore, Changeboxes capture the semantics of change. Changeboxes can be used, for example, to encapsulate refactorings, or to replay or analyze the history of changes. In this paper we introduce Changeboxes by means of a prototype implementation. We illustrate the benefits that Changeboxes offer for evolving software systems, and we present the results of a preliminary performance evaluation that assesses the costs associated with Changeboxes while suggesting possible strategies for improvement.},

Major drawbacks of this approach are (1) large amounts of data and (2) lack of support for sub-method elements. In this paper we propose to leverage sub-method reflection to identify and model features.

	Abstract = {Computational reflection is a fundamental mechanism in object oriented languages. Reflection has proved useful in many contexts, such as in the design of development environments, language extension, and the dynamic, unanticipated adaptation of running systems We identify three problems with the current approach to reflection in object oriented languages: partial behavioral reflection needs to be anticipated, structural reflection is limited to the granularity of a method, and behavioral reflection cannot be applied to the whole system. To address these problems, we extend structural reflection to cover sub-method elements and present how sub-method structural reflection supports unanticipated partial behavioral reflection. We add the concept of context to represent meta-level execution and show how this allows behavioral reflection to be applied even to system classes. We describe an implementation in Smalltalk. Benchmarks validate the practicability of our approach. In addition, we present an experimental evaluation in which we show how the system is used for dynamic analysis. We realize dynamic feature analysis by annotating the sub-method structure of the system directly to denote features instead of recording full execution traces.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral reflection is crucial to support for example functional upgrades, on-the-fly debugging, or monitoring critical applications. However the use of reflective features can lead to severe problems due to infinite metacall recursion even in simple cases. This is especially a problem when reflecting on core language features since there is a high chance that such features are used to implement the reflective behavior itself. In this paper we analyze the problem of infinite meta-object call recursion and solve it by providing a first class representation of meta-level execution: at any point in the execution of a system it can be determined if we are operating on a meta-level or base level so that we can prevent infinite recursion. We present how meta-level execution can be represented by a meta-context and how reflection becomes context-aware. Our solution makes it possible to freely apply behavioral reflection even on system classes: the meta-context brings stability to behavioral reflection. We validate the concept with a robust implementation and we present benchmarks.},

	Abstract = {A feature represents a functional requirement fulfilled by a system. Since many maintenance tasks are expressed in terms of features, it is important to establish the correspondence between a feature and its implementation in source code.  Traditional approaches to establish this correspondence exercise features to generate a trace of runtime events, which is then processed by post-mortem analysis.  These approaches typically generate large amounts of data to analyze. Due to their static nature, these approaches do not support incremental and interactive analysis of features. We propose a radically different approach called live feature analysis, which provides a model at runtime of features. Our approach analyzes features on a running system and also makes it possible to grow feature representations by exercising different scenarios of the same feature, and identifies execution elements even to the sub-method level.  We describe how live feature analysis is implemented effectively by annotating structural representations of code based on abstract syntax trees. We illustrate our live analysis with a case study where we achieve a more complete feature representation by exercising and merging variants of feature behavior and demonstrate the efficiency or our technique with benchmarks.},

One of its possible applications would be to help in solving the numerous problems that affect the software maintenance activity. Maintainers of legacy systems developed years ago with obsolete techniques and tools, and not documented, need all kinds of knowledge (application domain, programming skills, software engineering techniques, etc.) It is generally assumed that formalizing all this knowledge and recording it would be a worthwhile effort. However, research is still in a early stage and numerous questions need to be answered: What knowledge should be targeted first? Where to find this knowledge? etc. To answer these questions, one needs a precise understanding of what knowledge is at stake here. We, therefore, propose an ontology of the knowledge needed to perform software maintenance. This ontology would be most useful as a framework for future research in knowledge engineering for software maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Serializing object graphs is an important activity since objects should be stored and reloaded on different environments. There is a plethora of frameworks to serialize objects based on recursive parsing of the object graphs. However such approaches are often too slow. Most approaches are limited in their provided features. For example, several serializers do not support class shape changes, global references, transient references or hooks to execute something before or after being stored or loaded. Moreover, to be faster, some serializers are not written taking into account the object-oriented paradigm and they are sometimes even implemented in the Virtual Machine hampering code portability. VM-based serializers such as ImageSegment are difficult to understand, maintain, and fix. For the final user, it means a serializer which is difficult to customize, adapt or extend to his own needs. In this paper we present a general purpose object graph serializer based on a pickling format and algorithm. We implement and validate this approach in the Pharo Smalltalk environment. We demonstrate that we can build a really fast serializer without specific VM support, with a clean object-oriented design, and providing most possible required features for a serializer. We show that our approach is faster that traditional serializers and compare favorably with ImageSegment as soon as serialized objects are not in isolation.},

  Abstract     = {After working for some time, developers commit their code changes to a version control system. When doing
 so, they often bundle unrelated changes (e.g., bug fix and refactoring) in a single commit, thus creating a so-called tangled commit. Sharing tangled commits is problematic because it makes review, reversion, and integration of these commits harder and historical analyses of the project less reliable. Researchers have worked at untangling existing commits, i.e., finding which part of a commit relates to which task. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work in two ways: (1) A publicly available dataset of untangled code changes, created with the help of two developers who accurately split their code changes into self contained tasks over a period of four months; (2) a novel approach, EpiceaUntangler, to help developers share untangled commits (aka. atomic commits) by using fine-grained code change information. EpiceaUntangler is based and tested on the publicly available dataset, and further evaluated by deploying it to 7 developers, who used it for 2 weeks. We recorded a median success rate of 91% and average one of 75\%, in automatically creating clusters of untangled fine-grained code changes.},

	Abstract = {In software development, version control systems (VCS) provide branching and merging support tools. Such tools are popular among developers to concurrently change a codebase in separate lines and reconcile their changes automatically afterwards. However, two changes that are correct independently can introduce bugs when merged together. We call semantic merge conflicts this kind of bugs.
Change impact analysis (CIA) aims at estimating the effects of a change in a codebase. In this paper, we propose to detect semantic merge conflicts using CIA. On a merge, DELTAIMPACTFINDER analyzes and compares the impact of a change in its origin and destination branches. We call the difference between these two impacts the delta-impact. If the delta-impact is empty, then there is no indicator of a semantic merge conflict and the merge can continue automatically. Otherwise, the delta-impact contains what are the sources of possible conflicts.},

	Abstract = {Tuple spaces have turned out to be one of the most fundamental abstractions for coordinating communicating agents. At the same time, researchers continue to propose new variants of tuple spaces, since no one approach seems to be universally applicable to all problem domains. Some models offer a certain configurability, but existing approaches generally stop at afixed set of configuration options and static configuration at instantiation time. We argue that a more open approach is needed, and present OpenSpaces, an object-oriented framework that supports static configurability through subclassing across several dimensions, as well as dynamic configurability of policies through runtime composition. We introduce OpenSpaces by showing how it can be used to instantiate a typical application, and we present an overview of the framework, implemented in Smalltalk, detailing the various degrees of configurability.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the run-time behavior of object-oriented legacy systems is a complex task due to factors such as late binding and polymorphism.  Current approaches extract and use information from the complete execution trace of a system. The sheer size and complexity of such traces make their handling, storage, and analysis difficult. Current software systems which run almost non-stop do not permit such a full analysis. In this paper we present a lightweight approach based on the extraction of a condensed amount of information, e.g., measurements, that does not require a full trace. Using this condensed information, we propose a visualization approach which allows us to identify and understand certain aspects of the objects' lifetime such as their role played in the creation of other objects and the communication architecture they support.},

	Abstract = {Due to the size and the extreme complexity of legacy systems, it is nearly impossible to write from scratch tests before refactoring them. In addition object-oriented legacy systems present specific requirements to test them. Indeed late-binding allow subclasses to change fundamental aspects of the superclass code and in particular call flows.  Moreover Object-oriented programming promotes a distribution of the responsibilities to multiple entities leading to complex scenario to be tested.  In such a context one of the few trustable source of information is the execution of the application itself. Traditional forward engineering approaches such as unit testing do not really provide adequate solution to this problem. Therefore there is a need for a more expressive way of testing the execution of object-oriented applications. We propose to represent the trace of object-oriented applications as logic facts and express tests over the trace.  This way complex sequences of message exchanges, sequence matching, or expression of negative information are expressed in compact form. We validated our approach by implementing TestLog a prototype tool and testing the Moose reengineering environment and a meta-interpreter.},

	Abstract = {Developing web applications is difficult since (1) the client-server relationship is asymmetric: the server cannot update clients but only responds to client requests and (2) the navigation facilities of web browsers lead to a situation where servers cannot control the state of the clients.  Page-centric web application frameworks fail to offer adequate solutions to model control flow at a high-level of abstraction. Developers have to work manually around the shortcomings of the HTTP protocol. Some approaches offer better abstractions by composing an application out of components, however they still fail to offer modeling control flow at a high level. Continuation-based approaches solve this problem by providing the facilities to model a control flow over several pages with one piece of code. However combining multiple flows inside the same page is difficult. This article presents Seaside. Seaside is a framework which combines an object-oriented approach with a continuation-based one. A Seaside application is built out of components (i.e., objects) and the logic of the application benefits from the continuation-based program flow infrastructure.  Seaside offers a unique way to have multiple control flows on a page, one for each component. This enables the developer to write components that are highly reusable and that can be used to compose complex web applications with higher quality in less time.},

	Abstract = {Understanding source code is an important task in the maintenance of software systems. Legacy systems are not only limited to procedural languages, but are also written in object-oriented languages. In such a context, understanding classes is a key activity as they are the cornerstone of the object-oriented paradigm and the primary abstraction from which applications are built. Such an understanding is however difficult to obtain because of reasons such as the presence of late binding and inheritance. A first level of class understanding consists of the understanding of its overall structure, the control flow among its methods, and the accesses on its attributes. We propose a novel xvisualization of classes called class blueprint that is based on a semantically enriched visualization of the internal structure of classes. This visualization allows a software engineer to build a first mental model of a class that he validates via opportunistic code-reading. Furthermore, we have identified visual patterns that represent recurrent situations and as such convey additional information to the viewer. The contributions of this article are the class blueprint, a novel visualization of the internal structure of classes, the identification of visual patterns, and the definition of a vocabulary based on these visual patterns. We have performed several case studies of which one is presented in depth, and validated the usefulness of the approach in a controlled experiment.},

	Abstract = {In pure object-oriented languages, classes are objects, instances of other classes called metaclasses. In the same way as classes define the properties of their instances, metaclasses define the properties of classes. It is therefore very natural to wish to reuse class properties, utilizing them amongst several classes. However this introduced metaclass composition problems, i.e., code fragments applied to one class may break when used on another class due to the inheritance relationship between their respective metaclasses.  Numerous approaches have tried to solve metaclass composition problems, but they always resort to an ad-hoc manner of handling conflicting properties, alienating the meta-programmer. We propose a uniform approach that represents class properties as traits, groups of methods that act as a unit of reuse from which classes are composed. Like all the other classes in the system, metaclasses are composed out of traits. This solution supports the reuse of class properties, and their safe and automatic composition based on explicit conflict resolution. The paper discusses traits and our solution, shows concrete examples implemented in the Smalltalk environment Squeak, and compares our approach with existing models for composing class properties.},

Ideally if a legacy system is covered by tests, running the tests on the new version can identify potential differences or discrepancies. However, writing tests for an unknown and large system is difficult due to the lack of internal knowledge. It is especially difficult to bring the system to an appropriate state. Our solution is based on the acknowledgment that one of the few trustable piece of information available when approaching a legacy system is the running system itself. Our approach reifies the execution traces and uses logic programming to express tests on them. Thereby it eliminates the need to programatically bring the system in a particular state, and handles the test-writer a high-level abstraction mechanism to query the trace. The resulting system, called TESTLOG, was used on several real-world case studies to validate our claims.},

Unfortunately, due to the coarse granularity of inheritance, it may be difficult to decompose an application into an optimal class hierarchy that maximizes software reuse. Existing schemes based on single inheritance, multiple inheritance, or mixins, all pose numerous problems for reuse. To overcome these problems we propose traits, pure units of reuse consisting only of methods. We develop a formal model of traits that establishes how traits can be composed, either to form other traits, or to form classes. We also outline an experimental validation in which we apply traits to refactor a non-trivial application into composable units.},

Our technique is based on the notion of focus, which shows whether a property is well-encapsulated or cross-cutting, and the notion of spread, which shows whether the property is present in several parts of the system.  We present a basic visualization and complement it with measurements that quantify focus and spread.

	Abstract = {Although duplicated code is known to pose severe problems for software maintenance, it is difficult to identify in large systems. Many different techniques have been developed to detect software clones, some of which are very sophisticated, but are also expensive to implement and adapt.  Lightweight techniques based on simple string matching are easy to implement, but how effective are they? We present a simple stringbased approach which we have successfully applied to a number of different languages such COBOL, {Java}, C\+\+, Pascal, Python, Smalltalk, C and PDP-11 assembler. In each case the maximum time to adapt the approach to a new language was less than 45 minutes. In this article we investigate a number of simple variants of string-based clone detection that abstract away from common editing operations, and assess the quality of clone detection for very different case studies. Our results confirm that this inexpensive clone detection technique generally achieves high recall and acceptable precision. Over-zealous normalization of the code before comparison, however, can result in unacceptable numbers of false positives.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, many complex applications are built with a web browser as their main user interface. However, despite the increasing popularity of the web as an application platform, implementing and maintaining web applications still remains difficult and lags behind conventional desktop application development.  The underlying technologies such as HTTP for the interaction and XHTML/CSS for the presentation were originally built to display and link static documents. Unfortunately, most mainstream frameworks provide only little abstraction over the page-oriented structure imposed by those technologies. Inevitably, the goto-like manner of how pages are linked leads to spaghetti code and hampers reuse. In this article we present Seaside, a web application framework that provides an uniform and pure object-oriented view on web applications.  In this way, Seaside avoids the unwieldily goto-like style. Exploiting the reflective features of Smalltalk, Seaside reintroduces procedure call abstraction in the client-server context. Seaside's key concepts are: (i) a component architecture supporting multiple, simultaneously active control flows, (ii) a programmatic XHTML generation, and (iii) fully supported on-the-fly debugging, code-editing, and recompilation. In this article we discuss these key features of Seaside and explain how they are made possible by the dynamic nature and the reflective capabilities of Smalltalk.},

	Abstract = {A trait is a unit of behaviour that can be composed with other traits and used by classes. Traits offer an alternative to multiple inheritance. Conflict resolution of traits, while flexible, does not completely handle accidental method name conflicts: if a trait with method m is composed with another trait defining a different method m then resolving the conflict may prove delicate or infeasible in cases where both versions of m are still needed. In this paper we present freezable traits, which provide an expressive composition mechanism to support unanticipated method composition conflicts.  Our solution introduces private trait methods and lets the class composer change method visibility at composition time (from public to private and vice versa). Moreover two class composers may use different composition policies for the same trait, something which is not possible in mainstream languages. This approach respects the two main design principles of traits: the class composer is empowered and traits can be flattened away. We present an implementation of freezable traits in Smalltalk. As a side-effect of this implementation we introduced private (early-bound and invisible) methods to Smalltalk by distinguishing object-sends from self-sends. Our implementation uses compile-time bytecode manipulation and, as such, introduces no run-time penalties.},

	Abstract = {Large object-oriented applications are structured over large number of packages. Packages are important but complex structural entities that may be difficult to understand since they play different development roles (i.e., class containers, code ownership basic structure, architectural elements...). Maintainers of large applications face the problem of understanding how packages are structured in general and how they relate to each others. In this paper, we present a compact visualization, named Package Surface Blueprint, that qualifies the relationships that a package has with its neighbours. A Package Surface Blueprint represents packages around the notion of package surfaces: groups of relationships according to the packages they refer to. We present two specific views one stressing the references made by a package and another showing the inheritance structure of a package. We applied the visualization on two large case studies: ArgoUML and Squeak.},

	Abstract = {Single inheritance often forces developers to
                  duplicate code and logic. This widely recognized
                  situation affects both business code and tests. In a
                  large and complex application whose classes
                  implement many groups of methods (protocols),
                  duplication may also follow the application's
                  idiosyncrasies, making it difficult to specify,
                  maintain, and reuse tests. The research questions we
                  faced are (i) how can we reuse test specifications
                  across and within complex inheritance hierarchies,
                  especially in presence of orthogonal protocols; (ii)
                  how can we test interface behavior in a modular way;
                  (iii) how far can we reuse and parametrize
                  composable tests. In this paper, we compose tests
                  out of separately specified behavioral units of
                  reuse ---traits. We propose test traits, where: (i)
                  specific test cases are composed from independent
                  specifications; (ii) executable behavior
                  specifications may be reused orthogonally to the
                  class hierarchy under test; (iii) test fixtures are
                  external to the test specifications, thus are easier
                  to specialize. Traits have been successfully applied
                  to test two large and critical class libraries in
                  Pharo, a new Smalltalk dialect based on Squeak, but
                  are applicable to other languages with traits.},

	Abstract = {Traits are method groups that can be used to compose classes. They do not have a runtime existence and are conceptually folded into the classes that use them. Traits have been implemented in different languages. While implementing them in Smalltalk, our first reflex was to take advantage of the fact that traits are not run-time entities: we optimized the implementation for space and hence shared methods between traits and classes. However, by doing so we broke the introspective API of Smalltalk. This paper illustrates a more general problem seen in all reflective systems: the implementation serves both as a model for execution and as the model that is exposed to the programmer. There is a conflict of interests between the information necessary for execution and the information the programmer is interested in. In addition, as soon as the implementation is exposed via reflection, we are not free to optimize. As the complete implementation is visible reflectively, there is no way to hide the optimizations. Few papers report errors and this is one of them. We report our experience facing the initial API mismatch, which has a significant impact on the system because the language is reflective (i.e., written in itself and causally connected). We present the new introspective API we put in place.},

Still there is a lack for a serious and practically-oriented evaluation of metrics. Often metrics lack the property that the software reengineer or quality expert can easily understand the situation  summarized by the metrics.  In particular, since the exact notion of coupling and cohesion is complex, a particular focus on such point is important. In the first chapter of the present document, we present a list of software metrics, that are commonly used to measure object-oriented programs. In the second chapter we present our proposition for package metrics that capture package aspects such as information hiding and change impact limits.},

	Abstract = {The decomposition of a software application into components and connectors at the design stage has been promoted as a way to describe and reason about complex software architectures. There is, however, surprisingly little language support for this decomposition at implementation level. Interaction relationships which are identified at design time are lost as they get spread out into the participating entities at implementation. In this paper, we propose first-class connectors in an object-oriented language as a first step towards making software architecture more explicit at implementation level. Our connectors are run-time entities which control the interaction of components and can express a rich repertoire of interaction relationships. We show how connectors can be reused and how they enhance the reuse of components.},

	Abstract = {Although coordination of multiple activities is a fundamental goal of object-oriented concurrent programming languages, there is only limited support for their specification and abstraction at the language level. This leads to a mismatch between conceptional designs, using high-level abstractions, and the implementation, using the low-level coordination constructs. Often coordination is hard-wired into the components they coordinate, which leads to evolution, maintenance and composibility problems. We propose a model called FLO/C that relies on the notion of connectors. A connector is an entity that enforces the coordination of the entities it coordinates. This model supports a clear separation between the coordinated active objects and their coordination.  An active object only defines specific domain information and a connector only defines coordination between a group of active objects (its participants). The coordination is abstractly defined refering to components in terms of the object interface. Coordination and coordinated entities are independant and can evolve separately.  Coordination can be composed and replaced easily.},

Good tools for detecting duplicated code are scarce because of the large amount of data to be checked, because duplicated code is not known a priori and because especially it requires parsing technology. In this paper we show that is possible to circumvent these complicating factors by applying a language independent and lightweigth approach, i.e. a tool that requires no parsing and a little learning and configuration time, yet is able to detect a significant amount of code duplication. We validate our approach on a number of case studies, involving five different implementation languages and ranging from 256 K up untill 26Mb of source code.},

	Abstract = {In reengineering an object-oriented system we want to benefit from the expertise developed in earlier efforts. It is therefore essential to have a way to communicate expertise at different levels: from knowledge about how to approach a system to be reengineered, to knowledge about improving code by eliminating 'bad' style. In this paper we propose to use a pattern form to communicate knowledge about reengineering. A reengineering pattern connects an observable problem in the code to a reengineering goal: it describes the process of going from the existing legacy solution causing or aggravating the problem to a new refactored solution which meets the reengineering goal. It thus gives a method appropriate for a specific problem, rather than proposing a general methodology, and makes reference to the appropriate tools or techniques for obtaining the refactored solution. In this paper we discuss the role of reengineering patterns and contrast them with related kinds of patterns. We then highlight the form of reengineering patterns and present two simple patterns for type-check elimination.},

	Abstract = {When using Aspect-Oriented Programming, it is sometimes difficult to determine at which join point an aspect executes. Similarly, when considering one join point, knowing which aspects will execute there and in what order is non- trivial. This makes it difficult to understand how the application will behave. A number of visualizations have been proposed that attempt to provide support for such program understanding. However, they neither scale up to large code bases nor scale down to understanding what happens at a single join point. In this paper, we present AspectMaps - a visualization that scales in both directions, thanks to a multi-level selective structural zoom. We show how the use of AspectMaps allows for program understanding of code with aspects, revealing both a wealth of information of what can happen at one particular join point as well as allowing to see the ``big picture'' on a larger code base. We demonstrate the usefulness of AspectMaps on an example and present the results of a small user study that shows that AspectMaps outperforms other aspect visualization tools.},

	Abstract = {Integrated development environments (IDEs) have become the primary way to develop software. Besides just using the built-in features, it becomes more and more important to be able to extend the IDE with new features and extensions. Plugin architectures exist, but they show weaknesses related to unanticipated extensions and event handling. In this paper, we argue that a more general solution for extending IDEs is needed. We present and discuss a solution, motivated by a set of concrete examples: a domain specific aspect language for IDE events. In it, join points are events of interest that may trigger the advice in which the behavior of the IDE extension is called. We show how this allows for the development of IDE plugins and demonstrate the advantages over traditional publish/subscribe systems.},

	Abstract = {Many design guidelines state that a software system architecture should avoid cycles between its packages. Yet such cycles appear again and again in many programs. We believe that the existing approaches for cycle detection are too coarse to assist the developers to remove cycles from their programs. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm that performs a fine-grained analysis of the cycles among the packages of an application. In addition, we define a metric to rank cycles by their level of undesirability, prioritizing the cycles that seems the more undesired by the developers. Our approach is validated on two large and mature software systems in Java and Smalltalk.},

The objective of these tools is to reinforce a mental representation of the newly introduced concept. Tools can be physical objects or paper- pen based. We call these tools artefacts. In computer assisted environments, such artefacts are not always clearly present, those environments focus on the nature of the exercises (drills, quiz). To realise environments in closer relation to classroom teaching, we propose to analyse and categorise such artefacts: we used pedagogical literature and we extracted artefacts used in teaching multiplication. We present our infrastructure and a list of artefacts in the multiplication realm.},

	Abstract = {Although unit testing is essential for programming, current languages only barely support the developer in composing unit tests into new ones or in navigating between unit tests and their corresponding methods under test. We have taken several Smalltalk programs and analyzed the relationships between unit tests and methods under test, and the re- lationships amongst unit tests.  First results indicate that most unit tests can be seen or at least decomposed into commands which focus on single methods, and that large portions of unit tests overlap each other. But these relationships between unit tests and methods under test are not reflected in current languages. We therefore first conceptually extend the meta-model of Smalltalk with one-method commands so that unit tests become both com- posable and navigable. Then we introduce a first lightweight implementation of this meta model using method comments to differentiate between the several test phases of existing XUnit test case methods.},

Having the history of the code (i.e., the versions) could be of help if this would not imply analyzing a huge amount of data. In this paper we present an approach for identifying candidate classes for reverse engineering and reengineering efforts. Our solution is based on summarizing the changes in the evolution of object-oriented software systems by defining history measurements. Our approach, named Yesterday`s Weather, is an analysis based on the retrospective empirical observation that classes which changed the most in the recent past also suffer important changes in the near future. We apply this approach on two case studies and show how we can obtain an overview of the evolution of a system and pinpoint its classes that might change in the next versions.},

                  crosscut the system's structure. Understanding how

                  expected upfront. As time goes by, the knowledge of
                  the developers becomes more and more critical for
                  the process of understanding the system. That is,
                  when we want to understand a certain issue of the
                  system we ask the knowledgeable developers. Yet, in
                  large systems, not every developer is knowledgeable
                  in all the details of the system. Thus, we would
                  want to know which developer is knowledgeable in the
                  issue at hand. In this paper we make use of the

                  information when reasoning about the systems at hand
                  or when reasoning about general laws of software
                  evolution. Over the past 30 years more and more
                  research has been spent on understanding software
                  evolution. However, the approaches developed so far
                  do not rely on an explicit meta-model, and thus,
                  they make it difficult to reuse or compare their
                  results. We argue that there is a need for an
                  explicit meta-model for software evolution analysis.
                  We present a survey of the evolution analyses and
                  deduce a set of requirements that an evolution
                  meta-model should have. We define, Hismo, a
                  meta-model in which history is modeled as an
                  explicit entity. Hismo adds a time layer on top of
                  structural information, and provides a common
                  infrastructure for expressing and combining
                  evolution analyses and structural analyses. We
                  validate the usefulness of our a meta-model by

                  with new requirements, and due to design decisions,
                  the changes happen to crosscut the system's
                  structure. Understanding how changes appear in the
                  system can reveal hidden dependencies between
                  different entities of the system. We propose the
                  usage of concept analysis to identify groups of
                  entities that change in the same way and in the same
                  time. We apply our approach at different levels of
                  abstraction (i.e., method, class, package) and we
                  detect fine grained changes (i.e., statements were
                  added in a class, but no method was added there).
                  Concept analysis is a technique that identifies
                  entities that have the same properties, but it
                  requires manual inspection due to the large number
                  of candidates it detects. We propose a heuristic
                  that dramatically eliminate the false positives. We
                  apply our approach on two case studies and we show

	Abstract = {The emerging field of context-oriented programming
                  gives a predominant role to the execution context of
                  applications, and advocates the use of dedicated
                  mechanisms to allow the elegant expression of
                  behavioural adaptations to such context. With
                  suitable reflective facilities, language semantics
                  can be adapted to context by reusing the same
                  context-oriented mechanisms that allow base-level
                  adaptability. This kind of meta-level adaptability,
                  in which the computation model itself becomes
                  adaptable to context, gives rise to context-oriented
                  computational reflection. To explore this idea, we
                  set out to implement a simple software transactional
                  memory system that exploits meta-level adaptability
                  by regarding transactions as contexts, and adapting
                  fundamental system behaviour to such transactional
                  contexts. The implementation is succinct and
                  non-intrusive, giving us an indication of the power
                  lying at the crossroads of context-oriented
                  programming and computational reflection.},

                  that just by reading the source code, it is
                  difficult to determine how classes and methods

                  Moreover, dependencies between system features are

                  which features were modified to recover both the
                  change intention and its extent, namely which source
                  artifacts are affected. Typically, the
                  implementation of a feature crosscuts a number of
                  source artifacts. To obtain a mapping between
                  features to the source artifacts, we exercise the
                  features and capture their execution traces. However
                  this results in large traces that are difficult to
                  interpret. To tackle this issue we compact the
                  traces into simple sets of source artifacts that
                  participate in a feature's runtime behavior. We
                  refer to these compacted traces as feature views.
                  Within a feature view, we partition the source
                  artifacts into disjoint sets of characterized
                  software entities. The characterization defines the
                  level of participation of a source entity in the
                  features. We then analyze the features over several
                  versions of a system and we plot their evolution to
                  reveal how and hich features were affected by
                  changes in the code. We show the usefulness of our
                  approach by applying it to a case study where we
                  address the problem of merging parallel development
                  tracks of the same system.},

	Abstract = {Software systems are typically developed by teams of
                  developers, with responsibilities for different
                  parts of the code. Knowledge of how the developers
                  collaborate, and how their responsibilities are
                  distributed over the software artifacts is a
                  valuable source of information when reverse
                  engineering a system. Determining which developers
                  are responsible for which software artifacts (\eg
                  packages or classes) is just one perspective. In
                  this paper we complement the static perspective with
                  the dynamic perspective of a system in terms of its
                  features. We want to extract information about which
                  developers are responsible for which features. To
                  achieve these two perspectives, we correlate
                  developer responsibilities both with a structural
                  view of the system and with a feature view. We
                  identify which developers are responsible for which
                  features, and whether the responsibilities
                  correspond with structural source code artifacts or
                  with features. We apply our technique to two

                  as part of their course work, and to one large open

	Abstract = {Meta programming is the act of reasoning about a
                  computational system. For example, a program in
                  Prolog can reason about a program written in
                  Smalltalk. Reflection is a more powerful form of
                  meta programming where the same language is used to
                  reason about, and act upon, itself in a causally
                  connected way. Thus on the one hand we have meta
                  programming that allows different languages or
                  paradigms to be used, but without causal connection,
                  while on the other hand we have reflection that
                  offers causal connection but only for a single
                  language. This paper combines both and presents
                  inter-language reflection that allows one language
                  to reason about and change in a causally connected
                  way another language and vice versa. The fundamental
                  aspects of inter-language reflection and the
                  language symbiosis used therein, are discussed.
                  Moreover the implementation of two symbiotic
                  reflective languages is discussed: Agora/Java and
                  SOUL/Smalltalk.},

	Abstract = {We study good programming practices expressed in rules and detected by static analysis checkers such as PMD or FindBugs. To understand how violations to these rules are corrected and whether this can be automated, we need to identify in the source code where they appear and how they were fixed. This presents some similarities with research on understanding software bugs, their causes, their fixes, and how they could be avoided. The traditional method to identify how a bug or a rule violation were fixed consists in finding the commit that contains this fix and identifying what was changed in this commit. If the commit is small, all the lines changed are ascribed to the fixing of the rule violation or the bug. However, commits are not always atomic, and several fixes and even enhancements can be mixed in a single one (a large commit). In this case, it is impossible to detect which modifications contribute to which fix. In this paper, we are proposing a method that identifies precisely the modifications that are related to the correction of a rule violation. The same method could be applied to bug fixes, providing there is a test illustrating this bug. We validate our solution on a real world system and actual rules.},

This information may come from analysis of the source code, study of execution traces, computing of metrics, etc. One source of information received less attention than source code: the bugs on the system. Little is known about the evolutionary behavior, lifetime, distribution, and stability of bugs. In this paper, we propose to consider bugs as first class entities and a useful source of information that can answer such topics. Such analysis is inherently complex, because bugs are intangible, invisible, and difficult to be traced. Therefore, our tool extracts information about bugs from bug tracking systems, link this information to other software artifacts, and explore interactive visualizations of bugs that we call bug maps.},

	Abstract = {Tools to detect coding standard violations in source code are commonly used to improve code quality. One of their original goals is to prevent bugs, yet, a high number of false positives is generated by the rules of these tools, i.e., most warnings do not indicate real bugs. There are empirical evidences supporting the intuition that the rules enforced by such tools do not prevent the introduction of bugs in software. This may occur because the rules are too generic and do not focus on domain specific problems of the software under analysis. We underwent an investigation of rules created for a specific domain based on expert opinion to understand if such rules are worthwhile enforcing in the context of defect prevention. In this paper, we performed a systematic study to investigate the relation between generic and domain specific warnings and observed defects. From our experiment on a real case, long term evolution, software, we have found that domain specific rules provide better defect prevention than generic ones.},

	Abstract = {A significant percentage of warnings reported by tools to detect coding standard violations are false positives. Thus, there are some works dedicated to provide better rules by mining them from source code history, analyzing bug-fixes or changes between system releases. However, software evolves over time, and during development not only bugs are fixed, but also features are added, and code is refactored. In such cases, changes must be consistently applied in source code to avoid maintenance problems. In this paper, we propose to extract system specific rules by mining systematic changes over source code history, i.e., not just from bug-fixes or system releases, to ensure that changes are consistently applied over source code. We focus on structural changes done to support API modification or evolution with the goal of providing better rules to developers. Also, rules are mined from predefined rule patterns that ensure their quality. In order to assess the precision of such specific rules to detect real violations, we compare them with generic rules provided by tools to detect coding standard violations on four real world systems covering two programming languages. The results show that specific rules are more precise in identifying real violations in source code than generic ones, and thus can complement them.},

In real-world migrations, many methods in the newer version are not present in the old version (e.g., 60\% of the methods in Eclipse 2.0 were not in version 1.0). This requires changes to be consistently applied to reflect the new API and avoid further maintenance problems. In this paper, we propose a tool to extract rules by monitoring API changes applied in source code during system evolution. In this process, changes are mined at revision level in code history. Our tool focuses on mining invocation changes to keep track of how they are evolving. We also provide three case studies in order to evaluate the tool.},

	Abstract = {Software systems evolve by adding new features, fixing bugs or refactoring existing source code. During this process, some problems may occur (e.g., backward-incompatibility, missing or unclear method deprecation) causing evolving systems and their clients to be inconsistent or to fail, decreasing code quality. As nowadays software systems are frequently part of bigger ecosystems, such problems are even harder to handle because the impact may be large and unknown.One solution to deal with such maintainability problems is the usage of rules to ensure consistency. These rules may be created by experts or extracted from source code repositories, which are commonly evaluated in small-scale case studies. We argue that existing approaches lack of: (i) a deep understanding of the benefits provided by expert-based rules, (ii) a better use of source code repositories to extract history-based rules, and (iii) a large-scale analysis of the impact of source code evolution on the actual clients.In this thesis we propose to analyze and improve rules to better support developers keeping track of source code evolution. We cover three aspects. The benefits provided by expert-based rules: we report on an investigation of rules created based on expert opinion to understand whether they are worthwhile to be adopted given the cost to produce them. The improvement of history-based rules: we propose two solutions to extract better rules from source code history. The impact of source code evolution on a software ecosystem: we undergo an investigation, in a large-scale ecosystem, on the awareness of the client systems about source code evolution.We evaluated the proposed approaches qualitatively and quantitatively in real-world case studies, and, in many cases, with the help of experts on the system under analysis. The results we obtained demonstrate the usefulness of our approaches.},

	Abstract = {Understanding a software system by just analyzing the structure of the system reveals only half of the picture, since the structure tells us only how the code is working but not what the code is about. What the code is about can be found in the semantics of the source code: names of identifiers, comments etc. In this paper, we analyze how these terms are spread over the source artifacts using Latent Semantic Indexing, an information retrieval technique. We use the assumption that parts of the system that use similar terms are related. We cluster artifacts that use similar terms, and we reveal the most relevant terms for the computed clusters. Our approach works at the level of the source code which makes it language independent. Nevertheless, we correlated the semantics with structural information and we applied it at different levels of abstraction (e.g. classes, methods). We applied our approach on three large case studies and we report the results we obtained.},

                  Comprehension focus on program program structure or
                  external documentation. However, by analyzing formal
                  information the informal semantics contained in the
                  vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To
                  understand software as a whole, we need to enrich
                  software analysis with the developer knowledge
                  hidden in the code naming. This paper proposes the
                  use of information retrieval to exploit linguistic
                  information found in source code, such as identifier
                  names and comments. We introduce Semantic
                  Clustering, a technique based on Latent Semantic
                  Indexing and clustering to group source artifacts
                  that use similar vocabulary. We call these groups
                  semantic clusters and we interpret them as
                  linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the
                  code. We compare the topics to each other, identify
                  links between them, provide automatically retrieved
                  labels, and use a visualization to illustrate how
                  they are distributed over the system. Our approach
                  is language independent as it works at the level of

	Abstract = {Web development has moved from simple static pages to complex web applications, some of them
resembling desktop ones. In most of these applications the web browser acts as thin-client (or a view) of the
model that sits on the server. Despite the technological evolution of the web, there is still no standard
mechanism to send data or events from the server to the client without an explicit request from the later,
thus forcing the web browser to constantly poll the server for updates. To solve this problem a set of
techniques under the name of Comet were proposed, allowing to send information from the server to the web
browser without an explicit client request. In this paper we introduce Meteoroid, a Comet approach to make
live Seaside applications. Our framework exploits the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm for building
 simple yet scalable web applications, requiring very little programming effort.},

	Abstract = {When reengineering large systems, software developers would like to assess and compare the impact of multiple change scenarios without actually performing these changes. A change can be effected by applying a tool to the source code, or by a manual refactoring. In addition, tools run over a model are costly to redevelop. It raises an interesting challenge for tools implementors: how to support modification of large source code models to enable comparison of multiple versions. One naive approach is to copy the entire model after each modification. However, such an approach is too expensive in memory and execution time. In this paper we explore different implementations that source code metamodels support multiple versions of a system. We propose a solution based on dynamic binding of entities between multiple versions, providing good access performance while minimizing memory consumption.},

	Abstract = {Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) has been successfully applied to identify software
 dependencies among packages and subsystems. A number of algorithms were proposed to compute the
 matrix so that it highlights patterns and problematic dependencies between subsystems. However,
 existing DSM implementations often miss important information to fully support reengineering
 effort. For example, they do not clearly qualify and quantify problematic relationships,
 information which is crucial to support remediation tasks.
In this paper we present enriched DSM (eDSM) where cells are enriched with contextual information
 about (i) the type of dependencies (inheritance, class reference . . . ), (ii) the proportion of
 referencing entities, (iii) the proportion of referenced entities. We distinguish independent
 cycles and stress potentially simple fixes for cycles using coloring information. This work is
 language independent and has been implemented on top of the Moose reengineering environment. It has
 been applied to non-trivial case studies among which ArgoUML, and Morphic the UI framework
 available in two open-source Smalltalks, Squeak and Pharo. Solution to problems identified by eDSM
 have been performed and retrofitted in Pharo main distribution.},

	Abstract = {When reengineering software systems, maintainers should be able to assess and compare multiple change scenarios for a given goal, so as to choose the most pertinent one. Because they implicitly consider one single working copy, revision control systems do not scale up well to perform simultaneous analyses of multiple versions of systems. We designed Orion, an interactive prototyping tool for reengineering, to simulate changes and compare their impact on multiple versions of software source code models. Our approach offers an interactive simulation of changes, reuses existing assessment tools, and has the ability to hold multiple and branching versions simultaneously in memory. Specifically, we devise an infrastructure which optimizes memory usage of multiple versions for large models. This infrastructure uses an extension of the FAMIX source code meta-model but it is not limited to source code analysis tools since it can be applied to models in general. In this paper, we validate our approach by running benchmarks on memory usage and computation time of model queries on large models. Our benchmarks show that the Orion approach scales up well in terms of memory usage, while the current implementation could be optimized to lower its computation time. We also report on two large case studies on which we applied Orion.},

	Abstract = {Packages are complex entities and it can be difficult to understand them as they play different roles (e.g., core package, UI class container, tests package . . . ). In particular, package interdependencies make difficult their management (substitution, evolutions, deprecation). Understanding whether a package has high or low impact on the system is another valuable piece of information. In addition, package organization represents the backbone of large software system. It is is usually agreed that packages should form layered structures. However, identifying such layered structure is difficult since packages are often in cycles. Several approaches propose to recover software structure or to visualize classes or files organization. Only few approaches provide layered organization and in particular take cycle into account. In this paper, we propose an approach which provides (i) a strategy to highlight dependencies which break Acyclic Dependency Principle and (ii) an organization of package (even in presence of cycles) in multiple layers. While our approach can be run automatically, it also supports human inputs and constraints. We validate our approach with a preliminary study on the structure of the Moose software analysis platform: it shows promising results.},

	Abstract = {Software evolves over time with the modification, addition and removal of new classes, methods, functions, dependencies. A consequence is that behavior may not be placed in the right packages and the software modularization is broken. A good organization of classes into identifiable and collaborating packages eases the understanding, maintenance, test and evolution of software systems. We argue that maintainers lack tool support for understanding the concrete organization and for structuring packages within their context.
Our claim is that the maintenance of large software modularizations needs approaches that help (i) understanding the structure at package level and assessing its quality; (ii) identifying modularity problems; and (iii) take decisions and verify the impact of these decisions.
In this thesis, we propose ECOO, an approach to help reengineers identify and understand structural problems in software architectures and to support the remodularization activity. It concerns the three following research fields:
- Understanding package dependency problems. We propose visualizations to highlight cyclic dependencies problems at package level.
- Proposing dependencies to be changed for remodularization. The approach proposes dependencies to break to make the system more modular.
- Analyzing impact of change. The approach proposes a change impact analysis to try modifications before applying them on the real system.
The approaches presented in this thesis have been qualitatively and quantitatively validated and results have been taken into account in the reengineering of analyzed systems. The results we obtained demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.},

                  method bodies. In languages that support traits,
                  classes are composed out of traits. There are two
                  main advantages with traits. Firstly, decomposing
                  existing classes into traits from which they can be
                  recomposed improves the factoring of hierarchies.
                  Secondly it increases the library reuse potential by
                  providing more reusable traits. Identifying traits
                  and decomposing class hierarchies into traits is
                  therefore an important and challenging task to
                  facilitate maintainability and evolution. In this
                  paper we present how we use Formal Concept Analysis
                  to identify traits in inheritance hierarchies. Our
                  approach is two-staged: first we identify within a
                  hierarchy maximal groups of methods that have a set

  abstract = {Runtime metaprogramming enables many useful applications and is often a convenient solution to solve problems in a generic way, which makes it widely used in frameworks, middleware, and domain-specific languages. However, powerful metaobject protocols are rarely supported and even common concepts such as reflective method invocation or dynamic proxies are not optimized. Solutions proposed in literature either restrict the metaprogramming capabilities or require application or library developers to apply performance improving techniques. For overhead-free runtime metaprogramming, we demonstrate that dispatch chains, a generalized form of polymorphic inline caches common to self-optimizing interpreters, are a simple optimization at the language-implementation level. Our evaluation with self-optimizing interpreters shows that unrestricted metaobject protocols can be realized for the first time without runtime overhead, and that this optimization is applicable for just-in-time compilation of interpreters based on meta-tracing as well as partial evaluation. In this context, we also demonstrate that optimizing common reflective operations can lead to significant performance improvements for existing applications.},

  abstract = {Tracing and partial evaluation have been proposed as meta-compilation techniques for interpreters to make just-in-time compilation language-independent. They promise that programs executing on simple interpreters can reach performance of the same order of magnitude as if they would be executed on state-of-the-art virtual machines with highly optimizing just-in-time compilers built for a specific language. Tracing and partial evaluation approach this meta-compilation from two ends of a spectrum, resulting in different sets of tradeoffs.
This study investigates both approaches in the context of self-optimizing interpreters, a technique for building fast abstract-syntax-tree interpreters. Based on RPython for tracing and Truffle for partial evaluation, we assess the two approaches by comparing the impact of various optimizations on the performance of an interpreter for SOM, an object- oriented dynamically-typed language. The goal is to determine whether either approach yields clear performance or engineering benefits. We find that tracing and partial evaluation both reach roughly the same level of performance. SOM based on meta-tracing is on average 3x slower than Java, while SOM based on partial evaluation is on average 2.3x slower than Java. With respect to the engineering, tracing has however significant benefits, because it requires language implementers to apply fewer optimizations to reach the same level of performance.},

	Abstract = {Most of the current garbage collector implementations work by reachability. This means they only take care of the objects that nobody else points to. As a consequence, there are objects which are not really used but are not garbage collected because they are still referenced. Such unused but reachable objects create memory leaks. This is a problem because applications use much more memory than what is actually needed. In addition, they may get slower and crash. It is important to understand which parts of the system are instantiated but also which are used or unused. There is a plethora of work on runtime information or class instantiation visualizations but none of them show whether instances are actually used. Such information is important to identify memory leaks.
In this paper, we present some visualizations that show used/unused objects in object-oriented applications. For this, we use Distribution Map which is a visualization showing spread and focus of properties across systems. We extend Distribution Maps to represent the way classes are used or not, since we distinguish between a class that just has instances from one that has used instances. To identify unused objects, we modified the Pharo Virtual Machine.},

	Abstract = {In object-oriented systems, runtime memory is composed of an object graph in which objects refer to other objects. This graph of objects evolves while the system is running. Graph exporting and swapping are two important object graph operations. Exporting refers to copying the graph to some other memory so that it can be loaded by another system. Swapping refers to moving the graph to a secondary memory (e.g., a hard disk) to temporary release part of the primary memory.
While exporting and swapping are achieved in different ways, each of them faces a common and central problem which is the speed of the approach in presence of large object graphs. Nevertheless, most of the existing solutions do not address well this issue. Another challenge is to deal with extremely common situations where objects outside the exported/swapped graph point to objects inside the graph. To correctly load back an exported subgraph, it is necessary to compute and export extra information that is not explicit in the object subgraph. This extra information is needed because certain objects may require to be reinitialized or recreated, to run specific code before or after the loading, to be updated to a new class definition, etc.
In this paper, we present most of the general problems of object exporting and swapping. As a case of study, we present an analysis of ImageSegment, a fast solution to export and swap object graphs, developed by Dan Ingalls. ImageSegment addresses the speed problems in an efficient way, as shown by the results of several benchmarks we have conducted using Pharo Smalltalk. However, ImageSegment is not a panacea since it still has other problems that hampers its general use.},

Proxy objects are a widely used solution for different scenarios such as remote method invocation, future objects, behavioral reflection, object databases, inter-languages communications and bindings, access control, lazy or parallel evaluation, security, among others. Most proxy implementations support proxies for regular objects but they are unable to create proxies for classes or methods. Proxies can be complex to install, have a significant overhead, be limited to certain type of classes, etc. Moreover, most proxy implementations are not stratified at all and there is no separation between proxies and handlers. In this paper, we present Ghost, a uniform, light-weight and stratified general purpose proxy model and its Smalltalk implementation.Ghost supports proxies for classes or methods. When a proxy takes the place of a class it intercepts both, messages received by the class and lookup of methods for messages received by instances. Similarly, if a proxy takes the place of a method, then the method execution is intercepted too.},

	Abstract = {Large object-oriented applications  may occupy hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes of memory. During program execution, a large graph of objects is created and constantly changed.
Most object runtimes support some kind of automatic memory  management based on garbage collectors (GC) whose idea is the automatic destruction of unreferenced objects. However, there are referenced objects which are not used for a long period of time or that are used just once. These are not garbage-collected because they are still reachable and might be used in the future. Due to these unused objects, applications use much more resources than they actually need.
In this paper we present the challenges and possible approaches towards an unused object manager for Pharo. The goal is to use less memory by swapping out the unused objects to secondary memory and only leaving in primary memory only those objects which are needed and used. When one of the unused objects is needed, it is brought back into primary memory.},

	Abstract = {In object-oriented systems, runtime memory is composed of an object graph in which objects refer to other objects. This graph of objects evolves while the system is running.
Graph exporting and swapping are two important object graph operations.
Exporting refers to copying the graph to some other memory so that it can be loaded by another system.
Swapping refers to moving the graph to a secondary memory (for example, a hard disk) to  temporary release part of the primary memory (for example, RAM).
Exporting and swapping are achieved in different ways and the speed in presence of large object graphs is critical. Nevertheless, most of the existing solutions do not address well this issue. Another challenge is to deal with  common situations where objects outside the exported/swapped graph point to objects inside the graph. To correctly load back an exported subgraph, it is necessary to compute and export extra information that is not explicit in the object subgraph.  This extra information is needed because certain objects may require to be reinitialized or recreated, to run specific code before or after the loading, to be updated to a new class definition, etc.
In this paper, we present all general problems to our knowledge about object exporting and swapping. As a case of study, we present an analysis of ImageSegment, a fast solution to export and swap object graphs, developed by Dan Ingalls. ImageSegment addresses the speed problems in an efficient way, as shown by the results of several benchmarks we have conducted using Pharo Smalltalk.
However, ImageSegment is not a panacea since it still has other problems that hampers its general use.},

	Abstract = {During the execution of object-oriented applications, several millions of objects are created, used and then collected if they are not referenced. Problems appear when objects are unused but cannot be garbage-collected because they are still referenced from other objects. This is an issue because those objects waste primary memory and applications use more primary memory than what they actually need. We claim that relying on operating systems (OS) virtual memory is not always enough since it is completely transparent to applications. The OS cannot take into account the domain and structure of applications. At the same time, applications have no easy way to control nor influence memory management.
In this dissertation, we present Marea, an efficient application-level virtual memory for object-oriented programming languages. Its main goal is to offer the programmer a novel solution to handle application- level memory. Developers can instruct our system to release primary memory by swapping out unused yet referenced objects to secondary memory.
Marea is designed to: 1) save as much memory as possible i.e., the memory used by its infrastructure is minimal compared to the amount of memory released by swapping out unused objects, 2) minimize the runtime overhead i.e., the swapping process is fast enough to avoid slowing down primary computations of applications, and 3) allow the programmer to control or influence the objects to swap.
Besides describing the model and the algorithms behind Marea, we also present our implementation in the Pharo programming language. Our approach has been qualitatively and quantitatively validated. Our experiments and benchmarks on real-world applications show that Marea can reduce the memory footprint between 25\% and 40\%.},

	Abstract = {A proxy object is a surrogate or placeholder that controls access to another target object. Proxy objects are a widely used solution for different scenarios such as remote method invocation, future objects, behavioral reflection, object databases, inter-languages communications and bindings, access control, lazy or parallel evaluation, security, among others. Most proxy implementations support proxies for regular objects but are unable to create proxies for objects with an important role in the runtime infrastructure such as classes or methods. Proxies can be complex to install, they can have a significant overhead, they can be limited to certain kind of classes, etc. Moreover, proxy implementations are often not stratified and they do not have a clear separation between proxies (the objects intercepting messages) and handlers (the objects handling interceptions). In this paper, we present Ghost: a uniform and general-purpose proxy implementation for the Pharo programming language. Ghost provides low memory consuming proxies for regular objects as well as for classes and methods.
When a proxy takes the place of a class, it intercepts both the messages received by the class and the lookup of methods for messages received by its instances. Similarly, if a proxy takes the place of a method, then the method execution is intercepted too.},

	Abstract = {It is now understood that software metrics alone are not enough to characterize software quality. To cope with this problem, most of advanced and/or industrially validated quality models aggregate software metrics: for example, cyclomatic complexity is combined with test coverage to stress the fact that it is more important to cover complex methods than accessors. Yet, aggregating and weighting metrics to produce quality indexes is a difficult task. Indeed certain weighting approaches may lead to abnormal situations where a developer increasing the quality of a software component sees the overall quality degrade. Finally, mapping combinations of metric values to quality indexes may be a problem when using thresholds. In this paper, we present the problems we faced when designing the Squale quality model, then we present an empirical solution based on weighted aggregations and on continuous functions. The solution has been termed the Squale quality model and validated over 4 years with two large multinational companies: Air France-KLM and PSA Peugeot-Citroen.},

                  deep rut that has developed over the past 50 years.

                  enormous advances in hardware and internet

                  old-fashioned languages based on rigid, static,

                  evolution of living and open software models. Such
                  languages would require features such as dynamic
                  first-class namespaces, explicit meta-models,
                  optional, pluggable type systems, and incremental

                  software systems are built to last, over time they
                  degrade as much as any legacy software system. As a
                  consequence, one must invest in reengineering
                  efforts to keep further development costs down. Even
                  though software systems and their business contexts

                  uses to understand, analyze and transform these

                  one may identify various reengineering patterns that

                  difficult to realize in long-lived, large-scale
                  software systems. We argue that, in order to
                  effectively and efficiently deploy such changes,
                  adaptive applications must be built on an
                  infrastructure that is not just model-driven, but is
                  both model-centric and context-aware. Specifically,
                  this means that high-level, causally-connected
                  models of the application and the software
                  infrastructure itself should be available at
                  run-time, and that changes may need to be scoped to
                  the run-time execution context. We first review the
                  dimensions of software adaptation and evolution, and
                  then we show how model-centric design can address
                  the adaptation needs of a variety of applications
                  that span these dimensions. We demonstrate through
                  concrete examples how model-centric and
                  context-aware designs work at the level of
                  application interface, programming language and
                  runtime. We then propose a research agenda for a
                  model-centric development environment that supports
                  dynamic software adaptation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {{La construction de logiciels pour des appareils qui ne peuvent pas accueillir localement des outils de d{\'e}veloppement peut {\^e}tre difficile. Ces appareils soit ont une puissance de calcul trop limit{\'e}e pour ex{\'e}cuter un IDE (par exemple, smartphones), ou manquent d' interfaces d'entr{\'e}e / sortie appropri{\'e}es ({\'e}cran, clavier , souris) pour la programmation (par exemple, les robots mobiles) ou sont tout simplement inaccessibles pour des d{\'e}veloppements locaux (par exemple cloud - serveurs). Dans ces situations, les d{\'e}veloppeurs ont besoin d'une infrastructure appropri{\'e}e pour d{\'e}velopper et d{\'e}boguer des applications distantes. Des solutions de d{\'e}bogage {\`a} distance sont parfois d{\'e}licates {\`a} utiliser en raison de leur nature distribu{\'e}e. Les {\'e}tudes empiriques nous montrent que, en moyenne 10,5 minutes par heure de codage (plus de cinq semaines de travail de 40 heures par an) sont pass{\'e}es pour le re-d{\'e}ploiement d'applications pour corriger les bugs ou am{\'e}liorer leur fonctionnalit{\'e} [ZeroTurnAround 2011]. En plus, les solutions courantes manquent des am{\'e}nagements qui seraient autrement disponibles dans un contexte local, car c'est difficile de les reproduire {\`a} distance (par exemple d{\'e}bogage objet-centr{\'e} [Ressia 2012b]). Cet {\'e}tat influe sur la quantit{\'e} d' exp{\'e}rimentation au cours d'une session de d{\'e}bogage {\`a} distance - par rapport {\`a} un contexte local. Dans cette th{\`e}se, afin de surmonter ces probl{\`e}mes, nous identifions d'abord quatre propri{\'e}t{\'e}s d{\'e}sirables qu'une solution id{\'e}ale pour le d{\'e}bogage {\`a} distance doit pr{\'e}senter : l'interactivit{\'e}, l'instrumentation, la distribution et la s{\'e}curit{\'e}. L'interactivit{\'e} est la capacit{\'e} d'une solution de d{\'e}bogage {\`a} distance de mise {\`a} jour incr{\'e}mentale de toutes les parties d'une application sans perdre le contexte de d'ex{\'e}cution (sans arr{\^e}ter l'application). L'instrumentation est l'aptitude d'une solution de modifier la s{\'e}mantique d'un processus en cours en vue d'aider le d{\'e}bogage. La distribution est la capacit{\'e} d'une solution de d{\'e}bogage {\`a} adapter son cadre alors que le d{\'e}bogage d'une cible {\`a} distance. Enfin la s{\'e}curit{\'e} fait r{\'e}f{\'e}rence {\`a} la disponibilit{\'e} de conditions pr{\'e}alables pour l'authentification et la restriction d'acc{\`e}s. Compte tenu de ces propri{\'e}t{\'e}s, nous proposons Mercury, un mod{\`e}le de d{\'e}bogage {\`a} distance et une architecture pour des langues r{\'e}flexifs {\`a} objets. Mercury ouvre (1) l'interactivit{\'e} gr{\^a}ce {\`a} un m{\'e}ta-niveau {\`a} distance miroir bas{\'e} sur un lien de causalit{\'e} avec sa cible, (2) l'instrumentation {\`a} travers une intercession r{\'e}flective bas{\'e}e sur la r{\'e}ification de l'environnement d'ex{\'e}cution sous-jacent, (3) la distribution gr{\^a}ce {\`a} un middleware adaptable et (4) la s{\'e}curit{\'e} par la d{\'e}composition et l'authentification de l'acc{\`e}s aux aspects r{\'e}flexifs.

Yet controlling the run-time behavior of these reflective facilities introduces several challenges, such as computational overhead, the possibility of meta- recursion and an unclean separation of concerns between base and meta-level. In this paper we present five dimensions of meta-level control from related literature that try to remedy these problems. These dimensions are namely: temporal and spatial control, place- ment control, level control and identity control. We argue that the reification of the descriptive notion of the reflectogram, can unify the control of meta-level execution in all these five dimensions. We present a model for the reification of the reflectogram and validate our approach through a prototype implementation in the Pharo pro- gramming environment. Finally we detail a case-study on run-time tracing illustrating our approach.},

	Abstract ={Remote debugging facilities are a technical necessity for devices that lack appropriate input/output interfaces (display, keyboard, mouse) for program- ming (e.g., smartphones, mobile robots) or are simply unreachable for local development (e.g., cloud-servers). Yet remote debugging solutions can prove awkward to use due to re-deployments. Empirical studies show us that on aver- age 10.5 minutes per coding hour (over five 40-hour work weeks per year) are spent for re-deploying applications (including re-deployments during debugging). Moreover current solutions lack facilities that would otherwise be available in a local setting because it is difficult to reproduce them remotely. Our work identifies three desirable properties that a remote debugging solution should exhibit, namely: run-time evolution, semantic instrumentation and adaptable distribution. Given these properties we propose and validate Mercury, a remote debugging model based on reflection. Mercury supports run-time evolution through a causally connected remote meta-level, semantic instrumentation through the reification of the underlying execution environment and adaptable distribution through a modular architecture of the debugging middleware.},

                  Internet of Things\~(IoT), owing in large part to
                  the increased availability of consumer sensing
                  devices, including modern smart phones. However,
                  application development in the IoT still remains
                  challenging, since it involves dealing with several
                  related issues, such as lack of proper
                  identification of roles of various stakeholders, as
                  well as lack of suitable (high-level) abstractions
                  to address the large scale and heterogeneity in IoT
                  systems. Although the software engineering community
                  has proposed several approaches to address the above
                  in the general case, existing approaches for IoT
                  application development only cover limited subsets
                  of above mentioned challenges. In this paper, we
                  propose a multi-stage model-driven approach for IoT

                  definition of the role to be played by each

                  device developer, and network manager. The
                  abstractions provided to each stakeholder are
                  further customized using the inputs provided in the
                  earlier stages by other stakeholders. We have also
                  implemented code-generation and task-mapping
                  techniques to support our approach. Our initial
                  evaluation based on two realistic scenarios shows
                  that the use of our techniques/framework succeeds in

	Abstract = {Reflective architectures are a powerful solution for code browsing, debugging or in-language process handling. However, these reflective architectures show some limitations in edge cases of self-modification and self-monitoring. Modifying the modifier process or monitoring the monitor process in a reflective system alters the system itself, leading to the impossibility to perform some of those tasks properly. In this paper we analyze the problems of reflective architectures in the context of image based object-oriented languages and solve them by providing a first-class representation of an image: a virtualized image.
We present Oz, our virtual image solution. In Oz, a virtual image is represented by an object space. Through an object space, an image can manipulate the internal structure and control the execution of other images. An Oz object space allows one to introspect and modify execution information such as processes, contexts, existing classes and objects. We show how Oz solves the edge cases of reflective architectures by adding a third participant, and thus, removing the self modification and self-observation constraints.},

	Abstract = {Producing a small deployment version of an application is a challenge because static abstractions such as packages cannot anticipate the use of their parts. As such, an application often occupies more memory than actually needed. To solve this problem we propose Tornado, a technique to dynamically tailor applications to only embed code (classes and methods) they use. Tornado uses a run-fail-grow approach to prepare an application for deployment. It launches minimal version of an application and installs a minimal set of statements that will start the user's application. This application is run and these statements are executed. When the application fails because there are classes or methods missing, the necessary code is installed. The application is executed until it reaches a stable point, allowing possibly human interaction for applications with UIs. Thus, Tornado creates minimal memory footprint versions of applications by tailoring the whole application's code, including run-time and third party libraries. We used Tornado to tailor two different applications. We succeeded to tailor a hello world application to occupy 1% of its original size. We also experimented with a Seaside web application tailoring in one case only the application's and framework's code and the whole application's code in the other case. In this latter example, we reached memory savings of about 97%. In this report we present an overview on Tornado, and we give details of the results we obtained.},

	Abstract = {Code mobility is a mechanism that allows the migration of running programs between different environments. Such migration includes amongst others the migration of application data and resources. Application\'s data is is usually composed by elements of different nature: from printers and files, to framework and domain objects. This application data will be transported along with the code of its program in space (when serialized and deployed in another environment) or time (when a new session is started in a different point of time). The main problem when moving around code resides, in our understanding, to global state. While unreferenced leaf objects are garbage collected, those referenced (transitively) by some global object will remain alive. In order to support code mobility in time and space, we need to understand how global application data is used. With this purpose, we study and classify Pharo\'s global state. This classification uncovers some common patterns and provides a first insight on how global state should be managed, specially in code mobility scenarios. As a minor contribution, we also discuss solutions to each of the found categories.},

	Abstract = {Bootstrapping is a technique commonly known by its usage in language definition by the introduction of a compiler written in the same language it compiles.
		This process is important to understand and modify the definition of a given language using the same language, taking benefit of the abstractions and expression power it provides.
		A bootstrap, then, supports the evolution of a language.
		However, the infrastructure of reflective systems like Smalltalk includes, in addition to a compiler, an environment with several self-references.
		A reflective system bootstrap should consider all its infrastructural components.
		In this paper, we propose a definition of bootstrap for object-oriented reflective systems, we describe the architecture and components it should contain and we analyze the challenges it has to overcome.
		Finally, we present a reference bootstrap process for a reflective system and Hazelnut, its implementation for bootstrapping the Pharo Smalltalk-inspired system.},

	Abstract = {Bootstrapping is well known in the context of compilers, where a bootstrapped compiler can compile its own source code. Bootstrapping is a beneficial engineering practice because it raises the level of abstraction of a program making it easier to understand, optimize, evolve, etc. Bootstrapping a reflective object-oriented language is however more challenging, as we need also to initialize the runtime of the language with its initial objects and classes besides writing its compiler.
In this paper, we present a novel bootstrapping infrastructure for Pharo-like languages that allows us to easily extend and modify such languages. Our bootstrapping process relies on a first-class runtime. A first-class runtime is a meta-object that represents a program's runtime and provides a MOP to easily load code into it and manipulate its objects. It decouples the virtual machine (VM) and language concerns by introducing a clear VM-language interface. Using this process, we show how we succeeded to bootstrap a Smalltalk-based language named Candle and then extend it with traits in less than 250 lines of high-level Smalltalk code. We also show how we can bootstrap with minimal effort two other languages (Pharo and MetaTalk) with similar execution semantics but different object models.},

To tackle this challenge, we present Dy- namic Core Library Update (DCU) as an extension of Dy- namic Software Update (DSU) and our approach based on a virtualization architecture. Our solution supports the up- date of core libraries as any other normal library, avoiding the circular dependencies between the updater and the core libraries. Our benchmarks show that there is no evident per- formance overhead in comparison with a default execution.

 	abstract = {An application runtime is the set of software elements that represent an application during its execution. Application runtimes should be adaptable to different contexts. Advances in computing technology both in hardware and software indeed demand it. For example, on one hand we can think about extending a programming language to enhance the developers' productivity. On the other hand we can also think about transparently reducing the memory footprint of applications to make them fit in constrained resource scenarios e.g., low networks or limited memory availability. We propose Espell, a virtualization infrastructure for object-oriented high-level language runtimes. Espell provides a general purpose infrastructure to control and manipulate object-oriented runtimes in different situations. A first-class representation of an object-oriented runtime provides a high-level API for the manipulation of such runtime. A hypervisor uses this first-class object and manipulates it either directly or by executing arbitrary expressions into it. We show with our prototype that this infrastructure supports language bootstrapping and application runtime tailoring. Using bootstrapping we describe an object-oriented high-level language initialization in terms of itself. A bootstrapped language takes advantage of its own abstractions and is easier to extend. With application runtime tailoring we generate specialized applications by extracting the elements of a program that are used during execution. A tailored application encompasses only the classes and methods it needs and avoids the code bloat that appears from the usage of third-party libraries and frameworks.},

                  crucial to know their architecture. The first
                  problem is that unlike classes and packages,
                  architecture is not explicitly represented in the
                  code. The second problem is that successful
                  applications evolve over time, so their architecture

The study was intended as a preliminary work to get initial data on the type on knowledge used and the importance of each type of knowledge. For example, it is commonly assumed that application domain knowledge is important when doing maintenance. However nobody can tell exactly how much more important it is than Computer Science knowledge. We monitored six software engineers in two different organizations and analyzed the knowledge they used in their maintenance activity. In this paper we present and discuss some results and propose research directions from these. Our results include: the fact that software engineers rarely "search for" some new knowledge and rather work from what they already know; or the acknowledgment of a variation of the knowledge used depending on the organization one is working in. The most disturbing result is that, contrary to what is commonly assumed, the software engineers we studied seemed to make little use of application domain knowledge.},

                  application's metamodel often remains static after
                  the development phase and cannot be changed unless a
                  new development effort occurs. Yet, end users often
                  need to rapidly adapt their applications to new
                  business needs. In many cases, the end users would
                  know how to make the required adaptations, if only,
                  the application would let them do so. In this paper
                  we present how we built a runtime-dynamic
                  meta-environment by integrating Magritte, a
                  self-described metamodel, into Smalltalk's
                  reflective language model. Our solution offers the
                  best of both worlds: developers can develop their
                  applications using the same tools they were used to,
                  but at the same time they gain the power of
                  meta-programming. We show in particular that our
                  approach is adapted to support end user
                  customization of applications: the adaptive model of
                  Magritte enables to not only describe existing
                  classes, but also lets end users build their own
                  metamodels on the fly.},

                  of usage of multiple DSLs; and, most seriously,
                  existing host language tools are typically unaware
                  of the DSL extensions, thus hampering the
                  development process. Language boxes address these
                  issues by offering a simple, modular mechanism to
                  encapsulate (i) compositional changes to the host
                  language, (ii) transformations to address various
                  concerns such as compilation and highlighting, and
                  (iii) scoping rules to control visibility of
                  language extensions. We describe the design and
                  implementation of language boxes, and show with the
                  help of several examples how modular extensions can
                  be introduced to a host language and environment.},

                  ensure code quality by verifying compliance with
                  best practices for a particular programming
                  language. The proliferation of internal
                  domain-specific languages and models, however, poses
                  new challenges for such tools. Traditional program
                  checkers produce many false positives and fail to
                  accurately check constraints, best practices, common
                  errors, possible optimizations and portability
                  issues particular to domain-specific languages. We
                  advocate the use of dedicated rules to check
                  domain-specific practices. We demonstrate the
                  implementation of domain-specific rules, the
                  automatic fixing of violations, and their
                  application to two case-studies: (1) Seaside defines
                  several internal DSLs through a creative use of the
                  syntax of the host language; and (2) Magritte adds
                  meta-descriptions to existing code by means of
                  special methods. Our empirical validation
                  demonstrates that domain-specific program checking
                  significantly improves code quality when compared
                  with general purpose program checking.},

                  However, code duplication identification ends to

Such an approach basically checks whether the containing elements of a data structure are constituents of a pattern, described by the developer. This paper is a step towards having seamless object-oriented pattern matching, which would be applicable to any object in Pharo. We present a pattern matching library, called \phorms, which enables users to compose patterns using the syntax of the Pharo programming language. In this library, patterns are objects and therefore can be inspected and debugged using existing Pharo tools. Our solution is extensible unlike \emph{The Rewrite Engine} -- Pharo's current pattern matching facilities. Moreover, by treating patterns as first class objects, our library provides more flexibility in the pattern matching process.},

    Change prediction helps developers by recommending program entities that will have to be changed alongside the entities currently
    being changed. To evaluate their accuracy, current change prediction approaches use data from versioning systems such as CVS or SVN.
    These data sources provide a coarse-grained view of the development history that flattens the sequence of changes in a single commit.
    They are thus not a valid basis for evaluation in the case of development style prediction, where the order of the predictions has to
    match the order of the changes a developer makes.
    We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of change prediction approaches based on fine-grained change data recorded from IDE usage.
    Moreover, the change prediction approaches themselves can use the more accurate data to fine-tune their prediction. We present an
    evaluation procedure and use it on several change prediction approaches, both novel and from the literature, and report on the
    results.},

	Abstract = {The IDE used in most Smalltalk dialects such as Pharo, Squeak or Cincom Smalltalk did not evolve
significantly over the last years, if not to say decades. For other languages, for instance Java, the
available IDEs made tremendous progress as Eclipse or NetBeans illustrate. While the Smalltalk
IDE served as an exemplar for many years, other IDEs caught up or even overtook the erstwhile
leader in terms of feature-richness, usability, or code navigation facilities.
In this paper we first analyze the difficulty of software navigation in the Smalltalk IDE and second
illustrate with concrete examples the features we added to the Smalltalk IDE to fill the gap to
modern IDEs and to provide novel, improved means to navigate source space. We show that
thanks to the agility and dynamics of Smalltalk, we are able to extend and enhance with reasonable
effort the Smalltalk IDE to better support software navigation, program comprehension, and software
maintenance in general. One such support is the integration of dynamic information into the static
source views we are familiar with. Other means include easing the access to static information
(for instance by better arranging important packages) or helping developers re-locating artifacts
of interest (for example with a categorization system such as smart groups).},

	Abstract = {Navigating large software systems is difficult as the various artifacts are distributed in a huge space, while the relationships between different artifacts often remain hidden and obscure. As a consequence, developers using a modern interactive development environment (IDE) are forced to open views on numerous source artifacts to reveal these hidden relationships, leading to a crowded workspace with many opened windows or tabs. Developers often lose the overview in such a cluttered workspace as IDEs provide little support to get rid of unused windows. AutumnLeaves automatically selects windows unlikely for future use to be closed or grayed out while important ones are displayed more prominently. This reduces the number of windows opened at a time and adds structure to the developer's workspace. We validate AutumnLeaves with a benchmark evaluation using recorded navigation data of various developers to determine the prediction quality of the employed algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Navigating large software systems, even when using a modern IDE is difficult, since conceptually related software artifacts are distributed in a huge software space.
For most software maintenance tasks, only a small fraction of the entire software space is actually relevant. The IDE, however, does not reveal the task relevancy of source artifacts, thus developers cannot easily focus on the artifacts required to accomplish their tasks.
Smart Groups help developers to perform software maintenance tasks by representing groups of source artifacts that are relevant for the current task. Relevancy is determined by analyzing historical navigation and modification activities, evolutionary information, and runtime information.
The prediction quality of Smart Groups is validated with a benchmark evaluation using recorded development activities and evolutionary information from versioning systems.},

	Abstract = {The concept of interfaces is central to
                  object-oriented methodologies and is one of the most
                  attractive features of {Java} and COM. Although
                  Smalltalk always had interfaces implicitly, in
                  Smalltalk interfaces are not first-class objects: t
                  hey cannot be conversed with, referred to, or
                  reflected upon. Consequently, Smalltalkers have been
                  deprived of such an important and useful tool. Since
                  a fundamental feature of Smalltalk is that just
                  about everything in the language is an
                  implementation feature, explicit, static interfaces
                  can be added to Smalltalk using Smalltalk itself
                  with ease. However, such an addition would
                  short-change the powerful dynamic aspects of
                  Smalltalk. In this article we present
                  SmallInterfaces; a new ontology of dynamic i
                  nterfaces which makes a powerful use of the dynamic
                  nature of Smalltalk. SmallInterfaces adds interfaces
                  as honorary members to Smalltalk's extensive
                  reflection mechanism, in a manner portable across

	Abstract = {Filtering, mapping, and iterating collections are frequent operations. It is known that composing a number of these operations may create intermediate collections causing an additional and unnecessary over- head. To reduce the number of intermediate collections it is often necessary to rewrite the source code and combine the operations. However, for some cases such reduction becomes aplicable only after a source code refactoring (i.e., when the collection operations are in different methods) which could introduce code duplication.
In this paper we propose Collection Promises to dynamically compose collection operations in order to reduce the number of unnecessary intermediate collections. Collection Promises delay a number of collection operations and then merge them using com- positions rules. By using Collection Promises developers can auto- matically reduce the intermediate collections even if the collection operations are in different methods.},

	Abstract={During its lifetime, a software system might undergo a major transformation effort in its structure, for example to mi- grate to a new architecture or bring some drastic improvements to the system. Particularly in this context, we found evidences that some sequences of code changes are made in a systematic way. These sequences are composed of small code transformations (e.g., create a class, move a method) which are repeatedly applied to groups of related entities (e.g., a class and some of its methods). A typical example consists in the systematic introduction of a Factory design pattern on the classes of a package. We define these sequences as transformation patterns. In this paper, we identify examples of transformation patterns in real world software systems and study their properties: (i) they are specific to a system; (ii) they were applied manually; (iii) they were not always applied to all the software entities which could have been transformed; (iv) they were sometimes complex; and (v) they were not always applied in one shot but over several releases. These results suggest that transformation patterns could benefit from automated support in their application. From this study, we propose as future work to develop a macro recorder, a tool with which a developer records a sequence of code transformations and then automatically applies them in other parts of the system as a customizable, large-scale transformation operator.},

	Abstract = {During its lifetime, a software system is under continuous maintenance to remain useful. Maintenance can be achieved in activities such as adding new features, fixing bugs, improving the system’s structure, or adapting to new APIs. In such cases, developers sometimes perform sequences of code changes in a systematic way. These sequences consist of small code changes (e.g., create a class, then extract a method to this class), which are applied to groups of related code entities (e.g., some of the methods of a class). This paper presents the design and proof-of-concept implementation of a tool called MACRORECORDER. This tool records a sequence of code changes, then it allows the developer to generalize this sequence in order to apply it in other code locations. In this paper, we discuss MACRORECORDER’s approach that is independent of both development and transformation tools. The evaluation is based on previous work on repetitive code changes related to rearchitecting. MACRORECORDER was able to replay 92% of the examples, which consisted in up to seven code entities modified up to 66 times. The generation of a customizable, large-scale transformation operator has the potential to efficiently assist code maintenance},

	Abstract={Many techniques have been proposed in the literature to support architecture definition, conformance, and analysis. However, there is a lack of adoption of such techniques by the industry. Previous work have analyzed this poor support. Specifically, former approaches lack proper analysis techniques (e.g., detection of architectural inconsistencies), and they do not provide extension and addition of new features. In this paper, we present ORIONPLANNING, a prototype tool to assist refactorings at large scale. The tool provides support for model- based refactoring operations. These operations are performed in an interactive visualization. The contributions of the tool consist in: (i) providing iterative modifications in the architecture, and (ii) providing an environment for architecture inspection and definition of dependency rules. We evaluate ORIONPLANNING against practitioners' requirements on architecture definition listed in a previous survey. We also evaluate the tool in a concrete example of software remodularization.},

                  Traits solve both problems by factoring out shared

                  object-oriented programming, it is surprising to
                  note that mainstream object-oriented languages offer
                  only limited and fixed ways of encapsulating
                  methods. Typically one may only address two
                  categories of clients, users and heirs, and one must
                  bind visibility and access rights at an early stage.
                  This can lead to inflexible and fragile code as well
                  as clumsy workarounds. We propose a simple and
                  general solution to this problem in which
                  encapsulation policies can be specified separately
                  from implementations. As such they become
                  first-class composable entities that can be reused

                  traditionally been based on static type systems. As
                  a consequence, dynamically-typed languages have only
                  limited support for encapsulation. This is
                  surprising, considering that encapsulation is one of
                  the most fundamental and important concepts behind
                  object-oriented programming and that it is essential
                  for writing programs that are maintainable and
                  reliable, and that remain robust as they evolve. In
                  this paper we describe the problems that are caused
                  by insufficient encapsulation mechanisms and then
                  present object-oriented encapsulation, a simple and

                  bringing state of the art encapsulation features to

	Abstract = {Developing and maintaining software systems is a knowledge intensive task. One needs knowledge of the application domain of the software, the problem the system solves, the requirements for this problem, the architecture of the system and how the different parts fit together, how the system interacts with its environment, etc. More often than not, this knowledge is not documented and lives only in the head of the software engineers. It is, therefore, volatile and an organization may repeatedly pay professionals to rediscover a knowledge it previously acquired and lost. In recognition of this fact, knowledge management techniques such as Postmortem Analysis are being used to help salvage this knowledge. Traditionally, Postmortem Analysis has been applied at the end of software development projects with a focus on organizational aspects such as how to improve the execution of a process. In this paper, we present the application of Postmortem Analysis in a new context: for software maintenance projects. We also apply it, not only for process improvement, but to discover knowledge on the software maintained itself.},

                  program design supports working on current and

                  In this chapter we report on the adoption of design

	Abstract = {Context-aware applications behave differently
                  depending on the context in which they are running.
                  Since context-specific behavior tends to crosscut
                  base programs, it can advantageously be implemented
                  as aspects. This leads to the notion of
                  context-aware aspects, e.g., aspects whose behavior
                  depends on context. This paper analyzes the issue of
                  appropriate support from the aspect language to both
                  restrict the scope of aspects according to the
                  context and allow aspect definitions to access

                  open framework for context-aware aspects that allows
                  for the definition of first-class contexts and
                  supports the definition of context awareness
                  constructs for aspects, including the ability to
                  refer to past contexts, and to provide domain- and
                  application-specific constructs.},

Enabling fine-grained control over the communication between components becomes a major requirement. While software isolation has been studied for a long time in operating systems (OS), most programming languages lack support for isolation. In this context we explore the notion of proxy. A proxy is a surrogate for another object that controls access to this object. We are particularly interested in generic proxy implementations based on language-level reflection. We present an analysis that shows how these reflective proxies can propagate a security policy thanks to the transitive wrapping mechanism. We present a prototype implementation that support transitive wrapping and allows a fine-grained control over an isolated object graph.},

Delegation proxies permit different behavioral variations to be easily composed together. We show how delegation proxies enable behavioral variations that can propagate to dynamic extents.

                  feature that enables language extensions, generic
                  code, dynamic analyses, development tools, etc.
                  However, uncontrolled reflection breaks object

                  surface of programs e.g., malicious libraries can
                  use reflection to attack their client applications.
                  To bring reflection and object encapsulation back
                  together, we use dynamic object ownership to design
                  an access control policy to reflective operations.
                  This policy grants objects full reflective power
                  over the objects they own but limited reflective
                  power over other objects. Code is still able to use
                  advanced reflective operations but reflection cannot
                  be used as an attack vector anymore.},

	Abstract = {Users expect modern software to be both continually available and updated on the fly. Introduction of new features and integration of bug fixes should not trouble the smooth running of an application. Developers also benefit from dynamic modifications of software, e.g. they can adapt code to new unanticipated situations or they can run dynamic analyses to get feedback about the behavior of running applications for monitoring, debugging and optimization purposes. Programming languages and their runtimes should thus provides developers with mechanisms that improve software adaptability. At the same time, the increasing size and complexity of software call for applications made up of many interacting components developed by different parties. In this context, either all components are trusted or each component needs to be properly protected from other ones. For example, a plugin should not be able to manipulate the internal structures or leaks private data of its host application unrestrictedly. Likewise, a malicious library should not be able to corrupt its clients or interfere with their operations. Programming languages should thus provide developers with mechanisms that improve software isolation, such as encapsulation and custom access control policies. The need for dynamic adaptations that can change nearly every aspect of an application on the one hand and the need for properly confined components on the other hand pulls programming language design in two opposite directions: ei- ther more flexibility or more control. This dissertation studies this tension in the context of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages with two language mechanisms that promote software adaptability: reflection and extension methods. For both mechanisms, we demonstrate their usefulness, their harmful effect on encap- sulation and propose solutions to retain their power while maintaining encapsulation.},

                  behaviour --- is currently considered a key approach
                  for improving object-oriented software systems.
                  Unfortunately, all of the current refactoring tools
                  depend on language-dependent refactoring engines,
                  which prevents a smooth integration with mainstream
                  development environments. In this paper we
                  investigate the similarities between refactorings
                  for Smalltalk and {Java}, derive a
                  language-independent meta-model and show that it is
                  feasible to build a language-independent refactoring
                  engine on top of this meta-model. Our feasibility
                  study is validated by means of a tool prototype
                  which uses the same engine to refactor both
                  Smalltalk and {Java} code. Using our approach we
                  minimize the language-dependent part of refactoring
                  tools, providing a standard way for programmers and
                  tools to perform refactorings no matter what

                  work on the same software system. Especially there
                  is a need to reuse parser technology. Within the
                  FAMOOS project we have developed a model for
                  representing object-oriented software systems at the
                  program entity level. The model has been designed
                  for language independence, extensibility and
                  information exchange. For the actual exchange of
                  data we are currently moving to use XMI, a standard
                  for model-based information exchange.},

	Abstract = {Source code management systems record different versions of code. Tool support can then compute deltas between versions. To ease version history analysis we need adequate models to represent source code entities. Now naturally the questions of their definition, the abstractions they use, and the APIs of such models are raised, especially in the context of a reflective system which already offers a model of its own structure.
	We believe that this problem is due to the lack of a powerful code meta-model as well as an infrastructure. In Smalltalk, often several source code meta-models coexist: the Smalltalk reflective API coexists with the one of the Refactoring Engine or distributed versioning system such as Monticello or Store. While having specific meta-models is an adequate engineered solution, it multiplies  meta-models and it requires more maintenance efforts (e.g., duplication of tests, transformation between models), and more importantly hinders navigation tool reuse when meta-models do not offer polymorphic APIs.
	As a first step to provide an infrastructure to support history analysis, this article presents Ring, a unifying source code meta-model that can be used to support several activities and proposes a unified and layered approach to be the foundation for building an infrastructure for version and stream of change analyses. We re-implemented three tools based on Ring to show that it can be used as the underlying meta-model for remote and off-image browsing, scoping refactoring, and visualizing and analyzing changes. As a future work and based on Ring we will build a new generation of history analysis tools.},

@phdthesis{Uqui12b,
	Abstract = {Modern software is built by teams of developers that work in a collaborative environment. The goal of this kind of development is that multiple developers can work in parallel. They can alter a set of shared artifacts and inspect and integrate the source code changes of other developers. For example, bug fixes, enhancements, new features or adaptations due to changing environment might be integrated into the system release. At a technical level, a collaborative development process is supported by version control systems. Since these version control systems allow developers to work in their own branch, merging and integration have become an integral part of the development process.  These systems use automatic and advanced merging techniques to help developers to merge their modifications in the development repositories. However, these techniques do not guarantee to have a functional system. While the use of branching in the development process offers numerous advantages, the activity of merging and integrating changes is hampered by the lack of comprehensive support to assist developers in these activities.For example, the integration of changes can have an unexpected impact on the design or behavior of the system, leading to the introduction of subtle bugs. Furthermore, developers are not supported when integrating changes across branches (cherry picking), when dealing with branches that have diverged, when finding the dependencies between changes, or when assessing the potential impact of changes. In this dissertation we present an approach that aims at alleviating these problems by providing developers and, more precisely, integrators with semi-automated support for assisted integration within a branch and across branches. We focus on helping integrators with their information needs when understanding and integrating changes by means of characterizations of changes and streams of changes (i.e., sequence of successive changes within a branch) together with their dependencies.These characterizations rely on the first-class representation of systems' histories and changes based on program entities and their relationships rather than on files and text. For this, we provide a family of meta-models (Ring, RingH, RingS and RingC) that offer us the representation of program entities, systems' histories, changes and their dependencies, along with analyses for version comparison, and change and dependency identification. Instances of these meta-models are then used by our proposed tool support to enable integrators to analyze the characterizations and changes. Torch, a visual tool, and JET, a set of tools, actually provide the information needs to assist integration within a branch and across branches by means of the characterization of changes and streams of changes respectively.},

	Abstract = {Programming idioms, design patterns and application libraries often introduce
cumbersome and repetitive boilerplate code to a software system. Language
extensions and external DSLs (domain specific languages) are sometimes
introduced to reduce the need for boilerplate code, but they also complicate
the system by introducing the need for language dialects and inter-language
mediation.
To address this, we propose to extend the structural reflective model of the
language with object layouts, layout scopes and slots.
Based on the new reflective language model we can 1) provide behavioral hooks
to object layouts that are triggered when the fields of an object are accessed
and 2) simplify the implementation of state-related language extensions such as
stateful traits. By doing this we show how many idiomatic use cases that
normally require boilerplate code can be more effectively supported.
We present an implementation in Smalltalk, and illustrate its usage through a
series of extended examples.},

However, when one takes a closer look at it, one perceives that almost all this work is concerned with risk management for software development projects. The literature on risk management for software maintenance is much scarcer. On the other hand, software maintenance projects do present specificities that imply they offer different risks than development. This suggests that maintenance projects could greatly benefit from better risk management tools. One step in this direction would be to help identifying potential risk factors at the beginning of a maintenance project. For this, we propose a taxonomy of possible risks for software management projects. The ontology was created from: i) an extensive survey of risk management literature, to list known risk factors for software development; and, ii) an extensive survey of maintenance literature, to list known problems that may occur during maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Meta-programming is the act of using one system or
                  language to reason about another one. Reflection
                  describes systems that have access to and change a
                  causally connected representation of themselves,
                  hence leading to self-extensible systems . Up to
                  now, most of the reflective languages have been
                  implemented in the same paradigm. In this paper, we
                  propose \emph{symbiotic reflection} as a way to
                  integrate a meta programming language with the
                  object-oriented language it reasons about and is
                  implemented in. New to this approach is that any
                  element of the implementation language can be
                  reasoned about and acted upon (not only the self
                  representation), and that both languages are of
                  different paradigms. Moreover, every language
                  implementer that is faced with the problem of
                  allowing the base language to access the underlying
                  meta-language has to solve the problem of enabling
                  entity transfer between both worlds. We propose a
                  uniform schema, called upping/downing, to this
                  problem that avoid explicit wrapping or
                  typechecking. We illustrate this with SOUL (the
                  Smalltalk Open Unification Language), a logic
                  programming language in symbiotic reflection with
                  the object-oriented language Smalltalk. We show how
                  SOUL does logic reasoning directly on Smalltalk
                  objects, and how to use this to implement type

	Abstract = {Supporting reuse of existing pieces of code is one
                  of the main goals of software engineering. In the
                  name of reuse, module-based programming languages
                  came to be, only to be surpassed by object-oriented
                  technology. With the same motivation component-based
                  solutions are overtaking object-oriented solutions.
                  However, the delegation-only focus of
                  component-based programming risks of resulting in
                  the same problems that modular-based approaches ran
                  into. To counter this, we claim that one of th e
                  important problems that should be addressed by
                  component languages is the composition of
                  components. More specifically, we see component
                  languages where components are black-box
                  abstractions, and with (one or more) composition
                  languages to glue them tog ether. As an example we
                  show a functional (Piccola) and a logic (QSoul)
                  composition approach.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe an interesting context to
                  study formal methods for component systems: embedded
                  devices. The context of embedded devices is highly
                  constrained by the physical requirements the devices
                  have to adhere to. As a result, component models for
                  embedded devices are not general purpose but geared
                  towards these constrained contexts. In this paper we
                  give the concrete setting of the Pecos project (a
                  project with as goal component engineering for
                  embedded devices). We describe the Pecos component
                  model, and show possibilities where we think formal
                  verification could be useful. We would like to use
                  this as a very concrete example to discuss formal
                  verification techniques.},

@article{Wuyt04a,
	Abstract = {The increasing complexity of software development
                  spawns lots of specialised tools to edit code,
                  employ UML schemes, integrate documentation, and so
                  on. The problem is that the tool builders themselves
                  are responsible for making their tools interoperable
                  with other tools or development environments.
                  Because they cannot anticipate all other tools they
                  can integrate with, a lot of tools cannot
                  co-operate. This paper introduces the classication
                  model, a lightweight integration medium that enables
                  unrelated tools that were not meant to be integrated
                  to cooperate easily. Moreover, the tool integration
                  is done by a tool integrator, and not by the tool
                  builder. To validate this claim, we show how to
                  integrate several third-party tools using the
                  classication model, and how it forms the foundation
                  for the StarBrowser, a Smalltalk browser integrating
                  different tools.},

@article{Wuyt05a,
	Abstract = {Software for embedded systems must cope with a
                  variety of stringent constraints, such as real-time
                  requirements, small memory footprints, and low power
                  consumption. It is usually implemented using
                  low-level programming languages, and as a result has
                  not benefitted from component-based software
                  development techniques. This paper describes a
                  \emph{data-centric component model} for embedded
                  devices that (i) minimizes the number of concurrent
                  tasks needed to implement the system, (ii) allows
                  one to verify whether components meet their
                  deadlines by applying Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA),
                  and (iii) can generate and verify schedules using
                  Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). This model forms
                  the foundation for a suite of tools for specifying,
                  composing, verifying and deploying embedded software
                  components developed in the context of the \pecos
