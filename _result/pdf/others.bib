  abstract = {The regression test selection problem\textemdash{}selecting a subset of a test-suite given a change\textemdash{}has been studied widely over the past two decades. However, the problem has seen little attention when constrained to high-criticality developments and where a ``safe'' selection of tests need to be chosen. Further, no practical approaches have been presented for the programming language Ada. In this paper, we introduce an approach to solving the selection problem given a combination of both static and dynamic data for a program and a change-set. We present a change impact analysis for Ada that selects the safe set of tests that need to be re-executed to ensure no regressions. We have implemented the approach in the commercial, unit-testing tool VectorCAST, and validated it on a number of open-source examples. On an example of a fully-functioning Ada implementation of a DNS server (Ironsides), the experimental results show a 97\% reduction in test-case execution.},

	Abstract = {Accumulated changes on a software system are not uniformly distributed: some elements are changed much more often than others. For optimal impact, the always limited time and effort for complexity control work, the anti-regressive work, should be applied to the elements of the system which are complex. If two elements are similarly complex then we should improve the one that attract more changes. Based on this observation, we propose a maintenance guidance model (MGM) which is tested against real-world data in order to study how developers handle the complexity of their systems. MGM takes into account several dimensions of complexity: size, structural complexity and coupling. The results show that maintainers of the eight studied open source systems tend, in general, to prioritize their anti-regressive work in line with the predictions given by our MGM, even though, divergences also exist. MGM offers a history-focused alternative to existing approaches to the identification of elements for anti-regressive work, most of which use certain static code characteristics only. },

	Abstract = {Prediction of software defects works well within projects as long as there is a sufficient amount of data available to train any models. However, this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far, only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper, we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications, we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge, i.e., simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely, we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions. We also derived decision trees that can provide early estimates for precision, recall, and accuracy before a prediction is attempted.},

This means that code repositories of- ten include commits that contain tangled changes. The presence of such tangled changes hinders analyzing code repositories because most mining software repository (MSR) ap- proaches are designed with the assumption that every commit includes only changes for a single task. In this paper, we propose a technique to inform developers that they are in the process of committing tangled changes. The proposed technique utilizes the changes included in the past commits to judge whether a given commit includes tangled changes. If it determines that the proposed commit may include tangled changes, it offers suggestions on how the tangled changes can be split into a set of untangled changes.},

Information Retrieval (IR) is used to derive conceptual couplings from the source code in a single version (release) of a software system. Evolutionary couplings are mined from source code commits. The premise is that such combined methods provide improvements to the accuracy of impact sets. A rigorous empirical assessment on the changes of the open source systems Apache httpd, ArgoUML, iBatis, and KOffice is also reported. The results show that a combination of these two techniques, across several cut points, provides statistically significant improvements in accuracy over either of the two techniques used independently. Improvements in recall values of up to 20% over the conceptual technique in KOffice and up to 45% over the evolutionary technique in iBatis were reported.},

	Abstract = {Researchers use file-based Version Control System (VCS) as the primary source of code evolution data. VCSs are widely used by developers, thus, researchers get easy access to historical data of many projects. Although it is convenient, research based on VCS data is incomplete and imprecise. Moreover, answering questions that correlate code changes with other activities (e.g., test runs, refactoring) is impossible. Our tool, CodingTracker, non-intrusively records fine-grained and diverse data during code development. CodingTracker collected data from 24 de- velopers: 1,652 hours of development, 23,002 committed files, and 314,085 testcase runs.
This allows us to answer: How much code evolution data is not stored in VCS? How much do developers intersperse refactorings and edits in the same commit? How frequently do developers fix failing tests by changing the test itself? How many changes are committed to VCS without being tested? What is the temporal and spacial locality of changes?},

	Abstract = {Debuggers are crucial tools for developing object-oriented software systems
		as they give developers direct access to the running systems. Nevertheless, traditional
		debuggers rely on generic mechanisms to explore and exhibit the execution stack and system

		and abstractions from their application domains. This creates an abstraction gap between the
		debugging needs and the debugging support leading to an inefficient and error-prone debugging
		effort. To reduce this gap, we propose a framework for developing domain-specific debuggers
		called the Moldable Debugger. The Moldable Debugger is adapted to a domain by creating and
		combining domain-specific debugging operations with domain-specific debugging views, and adapts
		itself to a domain by selecting, at run time, appropriate debugging operations and views.
		We motivate the need for domain-specific debugging, identify a set of key requirements and show
		how our approach improves debugging by adapting the debugger to several domains.},

	Abstract = {Software development teams exchange source code in shared repositories. These repositories are kept consistent by having developers follow a commit policy, such as "Program edits can be committed only if all available tests succeed.'' Such policies may result in long intervals between commits, increasing the likelihood of duplicative develop- ment and merge conflicts. Furthermore, commit policies are generally not automatically enforceable.
We present a program analysis to identify committable changes that can be released early, without causing failures of existing tests, even in the presence of failing tests in a developer's local workspace. The algorithm can support relaxed commit policies that allow early release of changes, reducing the potential for merge conflicts. In experiments using several versions of a non-trivial software system with failing tests, 3 newly enabled commit policies were shown to allow a significant percentage of changes to be committed.},

	Abstract = {Statically typed programming languages allow earlier
                  error checking, better enforcement of disciplined
                  programming styles, and generation of more efficient
                  object code than languages where all type
                  consistency checks are performed at run time.
                  However, even in statically typed languages, there
                  is often the need to deal with data whose type
                  cannot be determined at compile time. To handle such
                  situations safely, we propose to add a type Dynamic
                  whose values are pairs of a value v and a type tag T
                  where v has the type denoted by T. Instances of
                  Dynamic are built with an explicit tagging construct
                  and inspected with a type safe typecas construct.
                  This paper explores the syntax, operational
                  semantics, and denotational semantics of a simple
                  language including the type Dynamic.},

	Abstract = {The fact that so many different kinds of
                  coordination models and languages have been proposed
                  suggests that no one single approach will be the
                  best for all coordination problems. Different
                  coordination styles exhibiting different properties
                  may be more suitable for some problems than others.
                  Like other architectural styles, coordination styles
                  can be expressed in terms of components, connectors
                  and composition rules. We propose an approach in
                  which coordination styles are expressed as component
                  algebras: components of various sorts can be
                  combined using operators that realize their
                  coordination, yielding other sorts of components. We
                  show how several coordination styles can be defined
                  and applied using Piccola, a small language for
                  composing software components. We furthermore show
                  how glue abstractions can be used to bridge
                  coordination styles when more than one style is
                  needed for a single application.},

	Abstract = {A namespace is a mapping from labels to values. Most
                  programming languages support different forms of
                  namespaces, such as records, dictionaries, objects,
                  environments, packages and even keyword based
                  parameters. Typically only a few of these notions
                  are first-class, leading to arbitrary restrictions
                  and limited abstraction power in the host language.
                  Piccola is a small language that unifies various
                  notions of namespaces as first-class forms, or
                  extensible, immutable records. By making namespaces
                  explicit, Piccola is easily able to express various
                  abstractions that would normally require more
                  heavyweight techniques, such as language extensions

	Abstract = {Object oriented languages cannot express certain
                  composition abstractions due to restricted
                  abstraction power. A number of approaches, like SOP
                  or AOP overcome this restriction, thus giving the
                  programmer more possibilities to get a higher degree
                  of separation of concern. We propose \emph{forms},
                  extensible mappings from labels to values, as
                  vehicle to implement and reason about composition
                  abstractions. Forms unify a variety of concepts such
                  as interfaces, environments, and contexts. We are
                  prototyping a composition language where forms are
                  the only and ubiquitous first class value. Using
                  forms, it is possible compose software artifacts
                  focusing on a single concern and thus achieve a high

	Abstract = {Although object-oriented languages are well-suited
                  to implementing software components, they fail to
                  shine in the construction of component-based
                  applications, largely because object-oriented design
                  tends to obscure a component-based architecture. We
                  propose to tackle this problem by clearly separating
                  component implementation and composition. Piccola is
                  a small "composition language" that embodies the
                  paradigm of "applications = components + scripts."
                  Piccola models components and composition
                  abstractions by means of a unifying foundation of
                  communicating concurrent agents. Flexibility and
                  extensibility are obtained by modelling both
                  interfaces to components and the contexts in which
                  they live by extensible records, or "forms". We
                  illustrate the realization of an architectural style
                  in Piccola and show how external components may be
                  adapted and composed according to the style. We show
                  how separating components from their composition can
                  improve maintainability.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented technology and design is not the
                  final answer to the recurrent problem of making
                  systems, on one hand, more open and flexible and, on
                  the other hand, more robust, safe, and fast. While
                  object-oriented languages have a lot of success in
                  implementing components, they have rather limited
                  support for expressing composition abstractions. As
                  such, the component-based software principle is only
                  partially supported by the object-oriented approach.
                  Component-based software development breaks down an
                  application into stable parts, i.e., the components,
                  and high-level abstractions for composing the
                  components. Flexibility is provided by the
                  possibility to recompose. How can we design a
                  composition language to support this metaphor? What
                  mechanisms are needed to encapsulate components, to
                  make their contextual assumptions explicit, and to
                  define composition abstractions in a compact way? We
                  argue that we should seek the minimal kernel of
                  mechanisms that allows us to define composition
                  abstractions, instead of adding additional language
                  constructs to the object-oriented paradigm. This is
                  necessary in order to reason about these
                  abstractions and derive properties of the composed
                  application. In this thesis we propose Forms, Agents
                  and Channels as this minimal set of abstractions.
                  Forms are extensible records unified with services.
                  They are primitive objects, act as explicit
                  namespaces, and encapsulate arguments to invoke
                  services. Agents are autonomous entities that
                  exchange forms along channels. We show that this
                  simple model is expressive enough to define
                  high-level composition abstractions while being
                  small enough to be mathematically tractable. We
                  present the formal model of forms, agents and
                  channels in terms of a composition calculus. We
                  encode the composition calculus into the
                  asynchronous pi-calculus and show the soundness of
                  this encoding. We define the composition language
                  Piccola on top of the composition calculus by adding
                  some syntactic sugar and by defining a bridge to
                  access external components. The usefulness of
                  Piccola is demonstrated by defining composition
                  abstractions and reasoning about them at the level
                  of the language. We present several kinds of
                  composition abstractions: wrappers to adapt
                  components, connectors to implement composition
                  styles, and coordination abstractions that cross-cut
                  the functional decomposition of a system. We also
                  demonstrate how to reason about composition and how
                  to use glue code to detect and fix compositional
                  mismatches.},

	Abstract = {Although the term ``software component'' has become
                  commonplace, there is no universally accepted
                  definition of the term, nor does there exist a
                  common foundation for specifying various kinds of
                  components and their compositions. We propose such a
                  foundation. The Piccola Calculus is a process
                  calculus, based on the asynchronous pi-calculus,
                  extended with explicit namespaces. The calculus is
                  high-level, rather than minimal, and is consequently
                  convenient for expressing and reasoning about
                  software components, and different styles of
                  composition. We motivate and present the calculus,
                  and outline how it is used to specify the semantics
                  of Piccola, a small composition language. We
                  demonstrate how the calculus can be used to simplify
                  compositions by partial evaluation, and we briefly
                  outline some other applications of the calculus to
                  reasoning about compositional styles.},

@inproceedings{Ages93a,
	Abstract = {We have designed and implemented a type inference
                  algorithm for the full Self language. The algorithm
                  can guarantee the safety and disambiguity of message
                  sends, and provide useful information for browsers
                  and optimizing compilers. Self features objects with
                  dynamic inheritance. This construct has until now
                  been considered incompatible with type inference
                  because it allows the inheritance graph to change
                  dynamically. Our algorithm handles this by deriving
                  and solving type constraints that simultaneously
                  define supersets of both the possible values of
                  expressions and of the possible inheritance graphs.
                  The apparent circularity is resolved by computing a
                  global fixed-point, in polynomial time. The
                  algorithm has been implemented and can successfully
                  handle the Self benchmark programs, which exist in
                  the "standard Self world" of more than 40,000 lines
                  of code.},

	Abstract = {We present a language framework for describing
                  dependable systems which emphasizes {\it modularity}
                  and {\it composition}. Dependability and
                  functionality aspects of an application may be
                  described separately providing a separation of
                  design concerns. Furthermore, the dependability
                  protocols of an application may be constructed
                  bottom-up as simple protocols that are composed into
                  more complex protocols. Composition makes it easier
                  to reason about dependability and supports the
                  construction of general reusable dependability
                  schemes. A significant aspect of our language
                  framework is that dependability protocols may be
                  loaded into a running application and installed
                  dynamically. Dynamic installation makes it possible
                  to impose additional dependability protocols on a
                  server as clients with new dependability demands are
                  integrated into a system. Similarly, if a given
                  dependability protocol is only necessary during some
                  critical phase of execution, it may be installed
                  during that period only.},

                  original interpretation of the Bhattacharyya metric
                  as a geometric similarity measure is reviewed and it
                  is pointed out that this derivation is independent
                  of the use of the Bhattacharyya measure as an upper
                  bound on the probability of misclassification in a
                  two-class problem. The affinity between the
                  Bhattacharyya and Matusita measures is described and
                  we suggest use of the Bhattacharyya measure for
                  comparing histogram data. We explain how the
                  chi-squared statistic compensates for the implicit
                  assumption of a Euclidean distance measure being the
                  shortest path between two points in high dimensional
                  space. By using the square-root transformation the

                  no singularity problems unlike those caused by the

@inproceedings{Aksi94a,
	Abstract = {It is generally claimed that object-based models are
                  very suitable for building distributed system
                  architectures since object interactions follow the
                  client-server model. To cope with the complexity of
                  today's distributed systems, however, we think that
                  high-level linguistic mechanisms are needed to
                  effectively structure, abstract and reuse object
                  interactions. For example, the conventional
                  object-oriented model does not provide high-level
                  language mechanisms to model layered system
                  architectures. Moreover, we consider the message
                  passing model of the conventional object-oriented
                  model as being too low-level because it can only
                  specify object interactions that involve two partner
                  objects at a time and its semantics cannot be
                  extended easily. This paper introduces Abstract
                  Communication Types (ACTs), which are objects that
                  abstract interactions among objects. ACT s make it
                  easier to model layered communication architectures,
                  to enforce the invariant behavior among objects, to
                  reduce the complexity of programs by hiding the
                  interaction details in separate modules and to
                  improve reusability through the application of
                  object-oriented principles to ACT classes. We
                  illustrate the concept of ACT s using the
                  composition filters model.},

@inproceedings{Anco07a,
	Abstract = {Although the C-based interpreter of Python is
                   reasonably fast, implementations on the CLI or the JVM
                   platforms offers some advantages in terms of robustness
                   and interoperability. Unfortunately, because the CLI
                   and JVM are primarily designed to execute statically
                   typed, object-oriented languages, most dynamic language
                   implementations cannot use the native bytecodes for
                   common operations like method calls and exception
                   handling; as a result, they are not able to take full
                   advantage of the power offered by the CLI and JVM. We
                   describe a different approach that attempts to preserve
                   the flexibility of Python, while still allowing for
                   efficient execution. This is achieved by limiting the
                   use of the more dynamic features of Python to an
                   initial, bootstrapping phase. This phase is used to
                   construct a final RPython (Restricted Python) program
                   that is actually executed. RPython is a proper subset
                   of Python, is statically typed, and does not allow
                   dynamic modification of class or method definitions;
                   however, it can still take advantage of Python features
                   such as mixins and first-class methods and classes.
                   This paper presents an overview of RPython, including
                   its design and its translation to both CLI and JVM
                   bytecode. We show how the bootstrapping phase can be
                   used to implement advanced features, like extensible
                   classes and generative programming. We also discuss
                   what work remains before RPython is truly ready for
                   general use, and compare the performance of RPython
                   with that of other approaches.},

                  features of objects (encapsulation, communication
                  etc.) are enhanced with synchronization and
                  coordination facilities using the declarative power
                  of rules. We propose two interpretation of rules one
                  re-active and the other pro-active, corresponding to
                  different kinds of interaction between the rules and
                  the objects. Finally, we consider the problem of
                  capturing domain-specific knowledge within a general
                  coordination framework, for which constraints offer
                  a promising direction of research.},

                  the description of temporal aspects of object
                  behaviour often turns out to be an important issue.
                  We present a collection of notions and concepts
                  intended for the description of the temporal order
                  in which messages are sent to and received from an
                  object. We also propose notions for the description
                  of the temporal order of messages exchanged between
                  cooperating objects related with part-of
                  relationships. Using propositional temporal logic as
                  the underlying formalism of our approach, we show
                  how to verify the consistency of object
                  specifications.},

                  development tools and environments, in order to take
                  architectural descriptions into account, is a
                  topical issue. Nowadays, the existing formalisms to
                  represent software architecture fail in providing a
                  clear semantics and only give an intuitive graphical
                  representation of the system as a whole. More
                  specifically, the framework architectures should
                  show the overall design and the specification of the
                  points of the variability of the framework, making
                  easier the reuse of the architectures, integration
                  with others frameworks and a reference to measure
                  the changes in subsequent versions of the
                  frameworks. In this paper we propose an approach to
                  describe the architecture of frameworks, combining
                  formal and non-formal formalisms: Wright, an
                  architectural description language developed at
                  Carnegie Mellon University, and architectural
                  patterns. Based on the study of several frameworks,
                  our objective was to produce a complete description
                  of a framework, to show the expressive power of both
                  approaches and to consider complementarity and
                  flexibility regarding to other approaches.},

                  During evolution and maintenance phases of a system,
                  the developer has to be able to understand how these
                  dependencies were defined and how they influence the
                  interaction of the artifacts. The developer must be
                  sure that modifications done in the system will not
                  break its behavior. In the most of the cases, this
                  happens because the dependencies are not documented.
                  We propose to tackle this problem in the context of
                  object oriented classes hierarchies using Concept
                  Analysis. We use different properties about

                  behaviour. Based on these results, we show a set of

                  development and testing is a class. So understanding
                  how a class is defined and behaves is important.
                  Considering that a class is composed of instance
                  variables and methods, the process is not so easy to
                  achieve because we must decide which different
                  viewpoints can help us to detect features of a
                  class. These viewpoints can include identifying
                  groups of methods accessing a (set of) instance
                  variable(s), groups of methods that interact among
                  themselves to provide a functionality or groups of

                  collaborations among software artifacts that are
                  implicit in the code. These collaboration patterns
                  are typically signs of applied idioms, conventions
                  and design patterns during the development of the
                  system, and may entail implicit contracts that
                  should be respected during maintenance, but are not

@phdthesis{Arev05a,
	Abstract = {Within object-oriented systems there are different
                  meaningful dependencies between different objects.
                  These dependencies reveal ``contracts",
                  ``collaborations" and ``relationships" between
                  classes, methods, packages and any development unit
                  in the systems. In most of the cases, these
                  dependencies are not explicit in the code. This
                  problem is due to inadequate or out-of-date
                  documentation and mechanisms such as dynamic
                  binding, inheritance and polymorphism that obscure
                  the presence of existing dependencies. These
                  dependencies play an important part in implicit
                  contracts between the various software artifacts of
                  the system. It is therefore essential that a
                  developer, who has to make changes or extensions to
                  an object-oriented system, understands the
                  dependencies among the classes. Lack of
                  understanding increases the risk that seemingly
                  innocuous changes break the implicit existing
                  contracts in the system. In short, implicit,
                  undocumented dependencies lead to ``fragile systems"
                  that are difficult to extend or modify correctly. In
                  this thesis we develop an approach --- based on a
                  methodology and a tool support --- to recover this
                  implicit information and generate ``high-level
                  views" of a system at different abstraction levels,
                  using a formal clustering technique called Formal
                  Concept Analysis (FCA). With these views, we help to
                  build the first mental model of a system. Thus the
                  implicit or lost information is made explicit and we
                  are able to find uses of coding styles, possible
                  bottlenecks and weakpoints of a system, identify
                  eventual contracts between the entities, ``patterns"
                  based on the dependencies and --- if possible ---
                  propose possible solutions to correct problems in
                  the code. With this approach we also evaluate which
                  are the advantages and disadvantages of using a
                  clustering technique in software reverse
                  engineering},

	Abstract = {The challenge facing the International Organization
                  for Standardization (ISO) in the early eighties, in
                  developing Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
                  protocol standards for network management, was to
                  ensure that such protocols should, on the one hand,
                  be standardised but, on the other, be capable of
                  managing a myriad of resource types. ISO met the
                  challenge by developing a single
                  internationally-standardised carriage protocol
                  (CMIP), and tools to produce information models that
                  would reflect the resources being managed. Such an
                  approach makes it possible for the same carriage
                  protocol to carry management messages for many
                  different types of resources. In developing its
                  information modelling tools and services, ISO has
                  adopted an object-oriented approach: the resources
                  to be managed are modelled as managed objects or
                  aggregates of managed objects. The managed-object
                  model is similar to popular object-oriented
                  programming-language models but it includes a number
                  of features that reflect the special requirements of
                  network management. These requirements include:
                  asynchronous operation, active resources, a
                  distributed environment, compatibility, and feature
                  optionality. Fulfilling these requirements lead to
                  the inclusion of concepts such as
                  event-notification, multiple object-selection,
                  packages, and allomorphism. The next generation of
                  network-management standards will need to address
                  the demands of large, multi-protocol, mutable
                  networks. How these requirements might affect the
                  evolution of the managed-object model and services
                  is considered.},

                  characteristics that a system must have to qualify
                  as an object-oriented database system. The authors
                  separate these characteristics into three groups:
                  \fIMandatory\fP, the ones the system must satisfy in
                  order to be termed an object-oriented database
                  system. These are complex objects, object identity,
                  encapsulation, types or classes, inheritance,
                  overriding combined with late binding,
                  extensibility, computational completeness,
                  persistence, secondary storage management,
                  concurrency, recovery, and an ad hoc query facility.
                  \fIOptional\fP, the ones that can be added to make
                  the system better, but which are not mandatory.
                  These are multiple inheritance, type checking and
                  inferencing, distribution, design transactions, and
                  versions. \fIOpen\fP, the points where the designer
                  can make a number of choices. These are the
                  programming paradigm, the representation system, the
                  type system, and uniformity. We have taken the
                  position, not so much expecting it to be the final
                  word as to erect a provisional landmark to orient
                  further debate.},

	Abstract = {\fIPersistent\fR object systems are highly-valued
                  technology because they offer an effective
                  foundation for building very long-lived
                  \fIpersistent application systems\fR (PAS). The
                  technology becomes more effective as it offers a
                  more consistently integrated computational context.
                  For it to be feasible to design and construct a PAS
                  it must be possible to incrementally add program and
                  data to the existing collection. For a PAS to endure
                  it must offer flexibility: a capacity to evolve and
                  change. This paper examines the capacity of
                  persistent object systems to accommodate incremental
                  construction and change. Established store based
                  technologies can support incremental construction
                  but methodologies are needed to deploy them
                  effectively. Evolving data description is one
                  motivation for inheritance but inheritance alone is
                  not enough to support change management. The case
                  for supporting incremental change is very
                  persuasive. The challenge is to provide technologies
                  that will facilitate it and methodologies that will
                  organize it. This paper identifies change absorbers
                  as a means of describing how changes should
                  propagate. It is argued that if we systematically
                  develop an adequate repertoire of change absorbers
                  then they will facilitate much better quality change
                  management.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented analysis methods can incorporate the
                  concept of constraints to express rules of the
                  problem domain in the specification model,
                  restricting the possible instances of the model. As
                  such, constraints describe properties that must be
                  true at each moment in time for the entire system ,
                  without determining how they are to be preserved.
                  The ways in which these constraints are introduced
                  in the model differ from method to method, and even
                  between distinct constraint types in a single
                  method. Different ways in which constraints can be
                  described, are illustrated and compared. Specifying
                  constraints as informal annotations or by
                  operational restrictions is too informal and low
                  level for analysis. According to the properties,
                  importance and influence of the constraint types on
                  the object model, they ought to be described
                  differently. Some constraints, such as connectivity
                  constraints, definition and as a reminder for these
                  kind of constraints Others, such as attribute value
                  constraints, are best introduced as independent
                  items part of a separate concept grafted on a
                  general model to get a consistent, unambiguous,
                  symmetrical and general applicable constraint
                  description. Yet others, such as relational and
                  existential dependency constraints, should be
                  expressed implicitly by a hierarchical model
                  structure. This approach enriches the object model
                  in such a way that it highlights the logical
                  structure of the problem domain to its right
                  extent.},

	Abstract = {Vast quantities of open source code are now
                  available online, presenting a great potential
                  resource for software developers. Yet the current
                  generation of open source code search engines fail
                  to take advantage of the rich structural information
                  contained in the code they index. We have developed
                  Sourcerer, an infrastructure for large-scale
                  indexing and analysis of open source code. By taking
                  full advantage of this structural information,
                  Sourcerer provides a foundation upon which state of
                  the art search engines and related tools easily be
                  built. We describe the Sourcerer infrastructure,
                  present the applications that we have built on top
                  of it, and discuss how existing tools could benefit
                  from using Sourcerer.},

	Abstract = {Copy-paste programming is dangerous as it may lead
                  to hidden dependencies between different parts of
                  the system. Modifying clones is not always straight
                  forward, because we might not know all the places
                  that need modification. This is even more of a
                  problem when several developers need to know about
                  how to change the clones. In this paper, we
                  correlate the code clones with the time of the
                  modification and with the developer that performed
                  the modification to detect patterns of how
                  developers copy from one another. We develop a
                  visualization, named Clone Evolution View, to
                  represent the evolution of the duplicated code. We
                  show the relevance of our approach on several large
                  case studies and we distill our experience in forms
                  of interesting copy patterns.},

	Abstract = {Several reengineering environments have been created
                  to provide for a unified infrastructure in which
                  various approaches can be employed together. While
                  the collaboration between tools is very strong
                  within such environments, currently the
                  inter-environmental collaboration is very weak and
                  happens mainly at the level of data-files exchange.
                  Consequently, the different groups of researchers
                  are only collaborating shallowly via data, rather
                  than at the level of analysis. In this demo, we
                  present NOREX, a distributed reengineering
                  environment that allows different groups of
                  researchers to transparently use and combine
                  existing techniques, and share their own,
                  transcending any parochial barriers (e.g.,
                  implementation language or environment).},

                  attributes and methods in the presence of subtyping.
                  The general (typed) set constructs of FM allow one
                  to deal with (database) constraints in TM. The paper
                  describes the theory of FM, and discusses the role
                  that set expressions may play in conceptual database
                  schemas. Special attention is paid to the treatment
                  of constraints, and a three-step specification
                  approach is proposed. This approach results in the
                  formal notion of database universe stated as an FM

                  describe this architecture. An object database
                  system supports an object database model. This model
                  can be decomposed into four different aspects: data,
                  behavior, persistence and naming. An object database
                  system consists of a database engine supporting all
                  or part of the database model. On top of this engine
                  are implemented a number of language interfaces: an
                  object definition language, an object query language
                  and one or several programming languages. These
                  programming languages can be internal or external.
                  Internal languages are fully managed within the
                  system, and are in general proprietary extensions of
                  existing programming languages (C, Smalltalk, Lisp
                  or C++). External languages are managed outside of
                  the database system and are in most case standard
                  languages (C++ or Smalltalk).},

	Abstract = {We propose to extend the CORBA interface definition
                  of distributed objects by a behavioral specification
                  based on high level Petri nets. This technique
                  allows specifying in an abstract, concise and
                  precise way the behavior of CORBA servers, including
                  internal concurrency and synchronization. As the
                  behavioral specification is fully executable, this
                  approach also enables early prototyping and testing
                  of a distributed object system as soon as the
                  behaviors of individual objects have been defined.
                  The paper discusses several implementation issues of
                  the multithreaded, distributed interpreter built for
                  that purpose. The high level of formality of the
                  chosen formalism allows for mathematical analysis of
                  behavioral specifications.},

	Abstract = {The paper reports on efforts to develop a formal
                  framework that contains most features found in
                  current object oriented database systems. The
                  framework contains two parts. The first is a
                  structural object model, including concepts such as
                  structured objects, identity, and some form of
                  inheritance. For this model, the paper explains the
                  distinction between values and abstract objects,
                  describes a system as a directed graph, and
                  discusses declarative languages. The second part
                  deals with higher-order concepts, such as classes
                  and functions as data, methods, and inheritance.

	Abstract = {Reuse in the early development phases of an
                  application can reduce the effort of producing
                  specifications and improve their quality. The paper
                  presents the requirement specification phase for
                  object-oriented applications under a reuse approach.
                  Object-oriented specifications are reused by
                  accessing a repository of reusable components and by
                  adapting them to the application requirements. A
                  model for specifications reuse based on the
                  composition approach is presented; the model is also
                  used to encode development knowledge guiding in the
                  specification activity. Specification reuse is
                  supported by a tool to select reusable components
                  and to guide the developer in tailoring the
                  components to the needs of a specific application.
                  The RECAST tool (REquirement Composition And
                  Specification Tool) presented in the paper has
                  functionalities for retrieving reusable components
                  from a repository and functionalities driving the
                  composition and tailoring activities, on the basis

	Abstract = {Unanticipated changes to complex software systems
                  can introduce anomalies such as duplicated code,
                  suboptimal inheritance relationships and a
                  proliferation of run-time downcasts. Refactoring to
                  eliminate these anomalies may not be an option, at
                  least in certain stages of software evolution. A
                  class extension is a method that is defined in a
                  module, but whose class is defined elsewhere. Class
                  extensions offer a convenient way to incrementally
                  modify existing classes when subclassing is
                  inappropriate. Unfortunately existing approaches
                  suffer from various limitations. Either class
                  extensions have a global impact, with possibly
                  negative effects for unexpected clients, or they
                  have a purely local impact, with negative results
                  for collaborating clients. Furthermore, conflicting
                  class extensions are either disallowed, or resolved
                  by linearization, with subsequent negative effects.
                  To solve these problems we present classboxes, a
                  module system for object-oriented languages that
                  provides for behavior refinement (i.e. method
                  addition and replacement). Moreover, the changes
                  made by a classbox are only visible to that classbox
                  (or classboxes that import it), a feature we call
                  local rebinding. We present an experimental
                  validation in which we apply the classbox model to
                  both dynamically and statically typed programming
                  languages. We used classboxes to refactor part of
                  the {Java} Swing library, and we show two extensions
                  built on top of classboxes which are (i) runtime
                  adaptation with dynamically classboxes and (ii)
                  expressing crosscutting changes.},

                  aspects application to be limited to a well defined

                  definitions. Classes can be imported into an
                  aspectbox defining a base system to which aspects
                  may then be applied. Refinements and instrumentation

	Abstract = {The use of Interpreter and Visitor design patterns
                  has been widely adopted to implement programming
                  language interpreters due to their expressive and
                  simple design. However, no general approach to
                  conceive a debugger is commonly adopted. This paper
                  presents the debuggable interpreter design pattern
                  as a general approach to extend a language
                  interpreter with debugging facilities such as
                  step-over and step-into. Moreover, it enables
                  multiple debuggers coexisting and extends the
                  Interpreter and Visitor design patterns with a few
                  hooks and a debugging service. SmallJS, an

@inproceedings{Bert99a,
	Abstract = {Several advanced applications, such as those dealing
                  with the Web, need to handle data whose structure is
                  not known a-priori. Such requirement severely limits
                  the applicability of traditional database
                  techniques, that are based on the fact that the
                  structure of data (e.g. the database schema) is
                  known before data are entered into the database.
                  Moreover, in traditional database systems, whenever
                  a data item (e.g. a tuple, an object, and so on) is
                  entered, the application specifies the collection
                  (e.g. relation, class, and so on) the data item
                  belongs to. Collections are the basis for handling
                  queries and indexing and therefore a proper
                  classification of data items in collections is
                  crucial. In this paper, we address this issue in the
                  context of an extended object-oriented data model.
                  We propose an approach to classify objects, created
                  without specifying the class they belong to, in the
                  most appropriate class of the schema, that is, the
                  class closest to the object state. In particular, we
                  introduce the notion of weak membership of an object
                  in a class, and define two measures, the conformity
                  and the heterogeneity degrees, exploited by our
                  classification algorithm to identify the most
                  appropriate class in which an object can be
                  classified, among the ones of which it is a weak
                  member.},

                  object-oriented language not only introduces a need
                  for location independent object invocation but also
                  has to cope with various object management
                  operations. These meta-operations include object
                  migration, object replication and granularity
                  control. Additionally, in a multithreaded environ-
                  ment, the concurrency control specifications defined
                  on an object by the application programmer must be
                  realised correctly. Our object invocation scheme
                  offers mechanisms for realising these management
                  operations and concurrency control transparently.
                  This scheme {based on reference objects} is generic
                  in the sense that it can be extented to realise some
                  additional object management operations currently
                  not supported by our prototype. This prototype is
                  realised in a C++ environment on various distributed

	Abstract = {This paper features a case study of a complex
                  parallel application (in the area of Molecular
                  Dynamics Simulation) modelled in a concurrent
                  object-oriented language. In this computational
                  model, application objects can exhibit some
                  autonomous behaviour and reside in a global object
                  space. At runtime, this object space can physically
                  be mapped on a distributed memory machine. The case
                  study indicates the pitfalls of pure name-based
                  object interaction. We show that due to the dynamic
                  nature of the interaction schemes between the
                  application objects, coordination primitives are
                  necessary to achieve expressive lucidity within a
                  programming language. As a result, two kinds of
                  semantics exist for coordination in the object
                  space: 1. Sender-initiated coordination by means of
                  pattern-based group communication. 2.
                  Receiver-initiated coordination by means of
                  multi-object synchronisation constraints. A language
                  framework is proposed that enables a programmer to
                  express both kinds of coordination, and a concise
                  implementation based on a meta-level architecture is
                  presented.},

                  domain specific framework for a calculation engine
                  to be used in financial trading software. It is as
                  such an example of using frameworks outside their

                  checking support for Sotograph, our software
                  analysis environment. Besides providing a

                  Sotograph supports also trend analysis. I.e., the

                  garbage collection can avoid the complexity and
                  overhead of a distributed algorithm by classifying
                  "exported" objects as persistent. The problem of

	Abstract = {Traits are an object-oriented programming language
                  construct that allow groups of methods to be named
                  and reused in arbitrary places in an inheritance
                  hierarchy. Classes can use methods from traits as
                  well as defining their own methods and instance
                  variables. Traits thus enable a new style of
                  programming, in which traits rather than classes are
                  the primary unit of reuse. However, the additional
                  sub-structure provided by traits is always optional:
                  a class written using traits can also be viewed as a
                  flat collection of methods, with no change in its
                  semantics. This paper describes the tool that
                  supports these two alternate views of a class,
                  called the traits browser, and the programming
                  methodology that we are starting to develop around

                  grouping and naming objects in an object-oriented
                  distributed system. Using Gaggles, client objects
                  can access distributed replicated services without
                  regard for the number of objects that provide the
                  service. Gaggles are not themselves a replication
                  mechanism; instead they enable programmers to
                  construct their own replicated distributed services
                  in whatever way is appropriate for the application
                  at hand, and then to encapsulate the result. From
                  the point of view of a client, a Gaggle can be named
                  and invoked exactly like an object. However, Gaggles
                  can be used to represent individual objects, several
                  ordinary objects, or even several other Gaggles. In
                  this way they encapsulate plurality. If a Gaggle is
                  used as an invokee, one of the objects that it
                  represents is chosen (non-deterministically) to
                  receive the invocation.},

@inproceedings{Bolz08a,
	Abstract = {We report on our experiences with the Spy project,
                  including implementation details and benchmark
                  results. Spy is a re-implementation of the Squeak
                  (i.e., Smalltalk-80) VM using the PyPy toolchain.
                  The PyPy project allows code written in RPython, a
                  subset of Python, to be translated to a multitude of
                  different backends and architectures. During the
                  translation, many aspects of the implementation can
                  be independently tuned, such as the garbage
                  collection algorithm or threading implementation. In
                  this way, a whole host of interpreters can be
                  derived from one abstract interpreter definition.
                  Spy aims to bring these benefits to Squeak, allowing
                  for greater portability and, eventually, improved
                  performance. The current Spy codebase is able to run
                  a small set of benchmarks that demonstrate
                  performance superior to many similar Smalltalk VMs,
                  but which still run slower than in Squeak itself.
                  Spy was built from scratch over the course of a week
                  during a joint Squeak-PyPy Sprint in Bern last
                  autumn.},

                  By introducing classes and mixins as the basic
                  object-oriented constructs in a lambda-calculus with
                  records and references, we obtain a system with an
                  intuitive operational semantics. New classes are
                  produced by applying mixins to superclasses. Objects
                  are represented by records and produced by
                  instantiating classes. The type system for objects
                  uses only functional, record, and reference types,
                  and there is a clean separation between subtyping
                  and inheritance.},

@inproceedings{Bour05a,
	Abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that
                  aims at improving software modularization. Indeed,
                  aspects are yet another dimension for structuring
                  applications. The notion of aspect refers to any
                  cross-cuting property. This definition encompasses
                  both functional (business) and non-functional
                  (infrastructure) properties. However, most
                  approaches for AOP focus on only one category of
                  aspects: either functional aspects or non-functional
                  ones. This paper aims at bridging the gap between
                  those two families. We present a solution for
                  describing both functional and non-functional
                  aspects in a uniform fashion. This solution relies
                  on reflection and mixin-based inheritance.},

	Abstract = {By means of an illustrative application, we discuss
                  the implementation choices of the rule-based
                  coordination language LO. Distributed applications
                  written in LO manifest two levels of granularity,
                  each with their specific communication paradigm. At
                  the finer level, individual objects are composed
                  into agents and communicate through blackboards. At
                  the coarser level, these agents interact through
                  broadcasts. This dichotomy determines implementation
                  choices: Concurrency among agents naturally maps
                  onto distributed processes (with e.g. RPC), whereas
                  concurrency among objects maps onto threads (in
                  shared memory). These four abstractions (objects,
                  blackboards, agents, and broadcasts) together with
                  LO 's basic computation paradigm (rules) are
                  implemented as a class-based run-time library,
                  thereby enriching classical object-oriented
                  platforms. Finally we stress the fact that the
                  resulting run-time library is poly- morphic: The
                  run-time can manipulate any independently defined
                  appli- cation object, provided its class respects a
                  minimal protocol. Run-time polymorphism has turned
                  out to be the key to composition-based reuse.},

                  built. This goal is made easier by demanding for
                  type orthogonal persistence and distribution as the
                  full power of the underlying language may then be
                  used when building higher level abstractions on top

                  implements many object-oriented features within a
                  conventional programming environment. The
                  methodology was created during the development of a
                  computer animation system, The Clockworks. The
                  methodology supports such object-oriented features
                  as objects with variables and methods, class
                  hierarchies, variable and method inheritance, object
                  instantiation and message passing. The methodology
                  does not employ any special keywords or language
                  extensions; thus removing the need for a
                  preprocessor or compiler. The methodology has been
                  implemented in a C/Unix environment. This allows the
                  environment and any system developed within it to be
                  ported to a wide variety of computers which support
                  Unix. The methodology provides many object-oriented
                  features and associated benefits. It also provides
                  all of the benefits of a C/Unix environment
                  including portability, a rich variety of development

                  tool for exploring mathematically-based interactions
                  which produce complex motions for computer
                  animation. The tool has been implemented as a class
                  in the object-oriented computer animation system The
                  Clockworks. It supports the definition of complex
                  interactions between geometric objects through the
                  specification of messages to the interacting
                  objects. Our approach is general, flexible and
                  powerful. The tool itself is not hardcoded to a
                  particular application. It simply sends the messages
                  specified by the user. Messages are specified as
                  strings which may be stored, modified and
                  interpreted. Since the tool is part of The
                  Clockworks it may utilize many of the powerful
                  features of the system, including data structuring,
                  mathematical, geometric modeling, and rendering
                  objects. The tool has been used to explore a general
                  spring and mass model, and the response of objects
                  in a vector field.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a technique that employs cost
                  functions to produce complex motions. Cost functions
                  can be used to define goal-oriented motions and
                  actions. A cost function can be defined whose
                  variables are the animated parameters of a scene.
                  The parameters are modified in such a way to
                  minimize the cost function. The minimum cost
                  configuration can be viewed as a "key goal"
                  configuration. The values of the parameters are
                  stored at certain intervals during the minimization
                  process. This produces a path through the parameter
                  space of the model being animated. By incrementally
                  moving along the parameter space curve and updating
                  the model defined by the parameters, an animation of
                  the model performing a goal-oriented action may be
                  produced. A class has been created and integrated
                  into the object-oriented system, The Clockworks,
                  which encapsulates the algorithm and data structures
                  necessary to implement the cost function approach.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes three message-based approaches
                  to choreography in computer animation. These
                  approaches may be placed in the following
                  categories, scripted choreography, choreography
                  driven by cost functions, and choreography produced
                  by interactions of autonomous entities. The main
                  concept that all of these forms of choreography
                  share is that they all rely upon the message passing
                  facilities of an object-oriented computer animation
                  system, The Clockworks. There are numerous benefits
                  derived from the message-based approach to computer
                  animation choreography. These include modularity,
                  unrestricted modification of parameters, interactive
                  alteration of messages, access to modeling and
                  graphics tools, and a versatile interpretive

                  programs. In particular it concerns formal methods
                  for the construction and verification of parallel
                  algorithms. We develop the theoretical foundations
                  of a language and a programming methodology for
                  designing parallel algorithms and illustrate the
                  methodology by presenting a concrete program
                  derivation. The goal of the methodology is to define
                  a mapping of a program specification into a
                  concurrent programming language. The methodology is
                  developed in the context of the {\it Unity}
                  formalism. We put special emphasis on derivation of
                  parallel algorithms thar are correct with respect to
                  some high-level program specification. The issue of
                  efficiency in the sense of execution time and space
                  is outside the scope of the present paper.},

	Abstract = {Seaside is a framework for developing sophisticated
                  web applications in Smalltalk. One thing missing
                  until now has been a way to automatically test the
                  running applications in a web browser. We could open
                  a browser and test some scenarios by hand. This is
                  not very effective for larger applications and for
                  regression testing though, so we need a way to write
                  automatic tests for our web applications. Albatross
                  is the key to this problem, because it allows us to
                  write tests directly in Smalltalk using the unit
                  testing framework. It opens the web application in
                  an external web browser and simulates user
                  interactions. It provides access to the running and
                  rendered web application and at the same time to the
                  model of your application. There is even no need of
                  bothering with HTML tags and ids, because Albatross
                  has cleverer ways to find out what to do. It finds
                  form fields just by identifying the corresponding
                  label text or clicks on links just by locating the

	Abstract = {Successful reverse engineering needs to take into
                  account human knowledge about architecture, about
                  features or even about validation of the results of
                  automatic analyses. This knowledge should be linked
                  to the automatically reverse engineered model and
                  should be taken into account by analyses. Typically,
                  when we want to reason about data, we first encode
                  an explicit meta- model and then express analyses at
                  that level. However, human knowledge is often
                  implicit and as a consequence it is not possible to
                  describe it comprehensively upfront. In this
                  dissertation we propose a generic approach to
                  iteratively enrich the system model with external
                  knowledge using annotations. Our mechanism allows
                  the reverse engineer to iteratively describe and
                  refine the annotations during the analysis process,
                  instead of requiring the meta-model to be built
                  upfront. As a validation of the expressiveness of
                  our framework, we show how we use it to support

	Abstract = {Much of the knowledge about software systems is
                  implicit, and therefore difficult to recover by
                  purely automated techniques. Architectural layers
                  and the externally visible features of software
                  systems are two examples of information that can be
                  difficult to detect from source code alone, and that
                  would benefit from additional human knowledge.
                  Typical approaches to reasoning about data involve
                  encoding an explicit meta-model and expressing
                  analyses at that level. Due to its informal nature,
                  however, human knowledge can be difficult to
                  characterize up-front and integrate into such a
                  meta-model. We propose a generic, annotation-based
                  approach to capture such knowledge during the
                  reverse engineering process. Annotation types can be
                  iteratively defined, refined and transformed,
                  without requiring a fixed meta-model to be defined
                  in advance. We show how our approach supports
                  reverse engineering by implementing it in a tool
                  called Metanool and by applying it to (i) analyzing
                  architectural layering, (ii) tracking reengineering
                  tasks, (iii) detecting design flaws, and (iv)
                  analyzing features.},

                  low-level style with close resemblance to the actual
                  working principle of the original system. We show a
                  different approach by creating a whole-system VM for
                  a hardware gaming device using a high-level language
                  and a high-level representation, which increases
                  readability and maintainability. By creating a fully
                  functional VM model which then can be compiled for
                  different architectures, we postpone low-level
                  optimizations to the compilation step. Our
                  high-level VM model written in Python is translated
                  using the PyPy toolchain, a sophisticated high-level

                  are generally implemented in low-level languages for
                  performance reasons. This results in unmaintainable
                  systems that are difficult to understand. In this
                  paper we report on our experience using the PyPy
                  toolchain to improve the portability and reduce the
                  complexity of whole-system VM implementations. As a
                  case study we implement a VM prototype for a
                  Nintendo Game Boy, called PyGirl, in which the
                  high-level model is separated from low-level VM
                  implementation issues. We shed light on the process
                  of refactoring from a low-level VM implementation in
                  Java to a high-level model in RPython. We show that

	Abstract = {Redocumentation and design recovery are two
                  important areas of reverse engineering. Detection of
                  recurring organizations of classes and communicating
                  objects, called Software Patterns, supports this
                  process. Many approaches to detect Software Patterns
                  have been published in the past years. Most of these
                  approaches need a pattern library as reference.
                  Personal coding style and domain specific
                  requirements lead to creating new patterns or
                  adapting existing ones and make those approaches
                  fail. The second problem is that the found patterns
                  of those methods are presented without connection to
                  the other patterns. To gain an overview of the whole
                  system and its mechanisms, we propose to set the
                  patterns in relation each other. Our work shows a
                  method to detect Software Patterns using Formal
                  Concept Analysis (FCA). The advantage of this
                  approach is that no reference library is needed and
                  the results are set in relation each other. FCA is a
                  mathematical theory which detects the presence of
                  groups of classes which instantiate a common,
                  repeated pattern. Those found patterns are presented
                  in a lattice, a partial order relation among the
                  patterns, which allows us to explore the pattern
                  which are in relation to them. We implemented a
                  prototype tool ConAn PaDi which navigates with the
                  Fish Eye View technique over the patterns. For
                  validation we applied this tool to three mid-sized
                  Smalltalk applications},

                  reengineer object-oriented systems. One feature of
                  this environment is to compute software measurements
                  based on the underlying FAMIX model. A problem of
                  this service was that many measurements were
                  computed but could not be used in an efficient
                  manner because they were not presented to the user.
                  The solution to this problem is a tool that displays
                  the computed measurements using a graphical user
                  interface. In this project, we developed the tool
                  MooseGager. This tool displays the computed
                  measurements of the entities of the underlying model
                  in a simple way and also offers the possibility to
                  generate charts based on these measurements. These

	Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of an object-oriented
                  systembased on various versions of source code
                  requires analyzing a vast amount of data since an
                  object-oriented system is a complex structure rather
                  than a collection of classes. Our work provides an
                  approach to understand such an evolution by
                  detecting and visualizing phases in the evolution,
                  i.e., abstractions of time spans where the
                  encapsulated versions all comply with an expression.
                  Our approach is applicable on any level, i.e., not
                  only on system level, but for example also on class
                  level. Our approach furthermore contains a set of
                  measurements on phases that characterize them.
                  Phases help understand an evolution because on the
                  one hand because they enable studying an evolution
                  on a higher level. On the other hand, phases can be
                  detected with multiple expressions at the same time.
                  This results in concurrent phases which enables
                  studying an evolution from different perspectives at

                  control systems have become an essential component
                  in collaborative software development. One such
                  version control system that has found generous
                  adoption in recent years is Subversion, a
                  centralized system that was designed explicitly to
                  match the requirements of the open-source community.
                  Equally, specialized web based tools have emerged to
                  browse and inspect version control systems such as
                  Subversion and have proven themselves to be valuable
                  instruments for the developers of software projects.
                  As projects become larger and more complex however,
                  these tools have often reached their limitations on
                  the level of introspecting they can provide. To
                  solve this problem we present Shrew, an approach to
                  analyze Subversion repositories that builds upon a
                  specialized meta-model and makes use of the Moose
                  object-oriented reengineering environment to
                  facilitate information extraction and that presents
                  its results with a convenient web interface.},

	Abstract = {Browsers are a crucial instrument to understand
                  complex systems or models. Each problem domain is
                  accompanied by an abundance of browsers that are
                  created to help analyze and interpret the underlying
                  elements. The issue with these browsers is that they
                  are frequently rewritten from scratch, making them
                  expensive to create and burdensome to maintain.
                  While many frameworks exist to ease the development
                  of user interfaces in general, they provide only
                  limited support to simplifying the creation of
                  browsers. In this thesis we present a dedicated
                  model to describe browsers that equally emphasizes
                  the control of navigation flow within the browser.
                  Our approach is designed to support arbitrary domain
                  models allowing researchers to quickly define new
                  browsers for their data. To validate our model we
                  have implemented the framework Glamour which
                  additionally offers a declarative language to
                  simplify the definition of browsers. We have used
                  Glamour to re-implement several existing browsers
                  and to explore the creation of new browsers.},

                  provides a too abstract description of conflicting
                  activities. Hence, we propose to replace it with a
                  unary conflict operator and a conflict restriction
                  operator, yielding the process algebra DiX. We show
                  that DiX is a semantic extension of CCS. Moreover,
                  DiX is equipped with a simple distributed semantics
                  defined in terms of nets with inhibitor arcs, where
                  the set of transitions is generated by three axiom

	Abstract = {Moose is a language independent tool environment to
                  reverse engineer and reengineer object-oriented
                  systems. It consists of a repository to store models
                  of software systems, provides query and navigation
                  facilities, metrics and other analysis support.
                  Models consist of entities representing software
                  artifacts such as classes and methods. This document
                  describes a metrics front-end for Moose, whose goal
                  is to visualize the relationship among different
                  metrics of the same model and export this
                  information to an external file. With this tool the
                  user can analyse software metrics and observe the
                  relationships among them. Collecting these
                  informations leads to a better understanding of the
                  software which has to be analysed or reengineered.
                  The ability to export metric values into an external
                  statistic tool such as MS Excel enables the user to
                  create diagrams and apply statistical analysis

                  meta-data versioning for object databases. However,

                  object database context. The semantics of virtual
                  databases is presented, and a mechanism for
                  interactively creating and deleting virtual
                  databases and manipulating their schemas and
                  instances is described. The application of the
                  virtual database concept to supporting both views
                  and versions in a unified manner is studied, and its

@inproceedings{Cabr07a,
	Abstract = {Most modern programming languages rely on exceptions
                  for dealing with abnormal situations. Although
                  exception handling was a significant improvement
                  over other mechanisms like checking return codes, it
                  is far from perfect. In fact, it can be argued that
                  this mechanism is seriously limited, if not, flawed.
                  This paper aims to contribute to the discussion by
                  providing quantitative measures on how programmers
                  are currently using exception handling. We examined
                  32 different applications, both for Java and .NET.
                  The major conclusion for this work is that
                  exceptions are not being correctly used as an error
                  recovery mechanism. Exception handlers are not
                  specialized enough for allowing recovery and,
                  typically, programmers just do one of the following
                  actions: logging, user notification and application
                  termination. To our knowledge, this is the most
                  comprehensive study done on exception handling to
                  date, providing a quantitative measure useful for
                  guiding the development of new error handling
                  mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {This thesis presents a proof system to support the
                  formal verification of the correctness of sequential
                  object-based programs written in a simple
                  programming language named A1. The proof system uses
                  a specification language named L1, that is based on
                  Hoare-style assertions. The syntax and formal
                  semantics of the programming and specification
                  languages are given. A formal semantics of
                  correctness formulas (for partial corretness) is
                  then defined. Axiom schemes and proof rules
                  associated with commands of A1, which compose a
                  proof system named P1, are presented. Example are
                  shown where these axioms schemes and proof rules are
                  used to derive program correctness. The proof system
                  P1 is shown to be sound according to the given
                  semantics of A1 and of the correctness formulas.},

	Abstract = {In December 1997, Sun Microsystems had just
                  announced its new flagship machine: a 64-processor
                  symmetric multiprocessor supporting up to 64
                  gigabytes of memory and thousands of I/O devices. As
                  with any new machine launch, Sun was working
                  feverishly on benchmarks to prove the
                  machine\&rsquo;s performance. While the benchmarks
                  were generally impressive, there was one in
                  particular\&mdash;an especially complicated
                  benchmark involving several machines\&mdash;that was
                  exhibiting unexpectedly low performance. The
                  benchmark machine\&mdash;a fully racked-out behemoth
                  with the maximum configuration of 64
                  processors\&mdash;would occasionally become
                  mysteriously distracted: Benchmark activity would
                  practically cease, but the operating system kernel
                  remained furiously busy. After some number of
                  minutes spent on unknown work, the operating system
                  would suddenly right itself: Benchmark activity
                  would resume at full throttle and run to completion.
                  Those running the benchmark could see that the
                  machine was on course to break the world record, but
                  these minutes-long periods of unknown kernel
                  activity were enough to be the difference between
                  first and worst.},

                  concurrent systems. In addition to standard logical
                  and temporal operators, our logic includes spatial
                  operations corresponding to composition, local name
                  restriction, and a primitive fresh name quantifier.
                  Properties can also be defined by recursion; a
                  central theme of this paper is then the combination
                  of a logical notion of freshness with inductive and

	Abstract = {Software components developed with an
                  object-oriented language undergo considerable
                  reprogramming before they become reusable in a wide
                  range of applications or domains. Tools and
                  methodologies are therefore needed to cope with the
                  complexity of designing, updating and reorganizing
                  vast collections of classes. This paper describes
                  several techniques for controlling change in
                  object-oriented systems, illustrates their
                  functionality with selected examples and discusses

                  management, we propose new algorithms for
                  automatically restructuring a hierarchy when classes
                  are added to it. These algorithms not only help in
                  handling modifications to libraries of software
                  components, but they also provide useful guidance
                  for detecting and correcting improper class
                  modelling.},

                  design decisions, software components developed with

                  reorganisations before they become stable, reusable
                  classes. We propose a new incremental algorithm that
                  analyses the redefinitions carried out on inherited
                  properties when a class is added to a hierarchy, and
                  restructures the hierarchy to discover missing
                  abstractions and to enforce programming style
                  guidelines. We illustrate our automatic
                  restructuring approach with simple examples,
                  describe formally the algorithm and the object model
                  it is based on, and discuss its suitability for

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of the notion of
                  method as it is currently used in most
                  object-oriented languages. We define polymethods as
                  methods that we can attach directly to types, as
                  opposed to classes and that we can describe with a
                  second-order type. Two benefits result from this
                  extension; first, the expressive power of the
                  language is improved with better modeling abilities.
                  Next, second-order types yield a more powerful
                  (precise) type inference, which extends the range of
                  static type checking in a truly extensible
                  object-oriented language. We first show that
                  extensible object-oriented languages present many
                  difficulties for static type-checking and that
                  second-order types are necessary to get stronger
                  type-checking. We illustrate how to combine
                  polymethods through type inheritance and propose a
                  technique based on abstract interpretation to derive
                  a second-order type for new polymethods.},

                  predicate class has a set of superclasses, methods,
                  and instance variables. However, unlike a normal
                  class, an object is automatically an instance of a
                  predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
                  expression associated with the predicate class. The
                  predicate expression can test the value or state of
                  the object, thus supporting a form of implicit
                  property-based classification that augments the
                  explicit type-based classification provided by
                  normal classes. By associating methods with
                  predicate classes, method lookup can depend not only
                  on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
                  dynamic value or state. If an object is modified,
                  the property-based classification of an object can
                  change over time, implementing shifts in major
                  behavior modes of the object. A version of predicate
                  classes has been designed and implemented in the
                  context of the Cecil language.},

	Abstract = {Software developers are rooted in the written form
                  of their code, yet they often draw diagrams
                  representing their code. Unfortunately, we still
                  know little about how and why they create these
                  diagrams, and so there is little research to inform
                  the design of visual tools to support developers'
                  work. This paper presents findings from
                  semi-structured interviews that have been validated
                  with a structured survey. Results show that most of
                  the diagrams had a transient nature because of the
                  high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to
                  electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented
                  design decisions were often externalized in these
                  temporary drawings and then subsequently lost.
                  Current visualization tools and the software
                  development practices that we observed do not solve
                  these issues, but these results suggest several
                  directions for future research.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for designing
                  extensible languages for distributed computing. As a
                  sample product of this methodology, which is based
                  on a meta-level (or reflective) technique, this
                  paper describes a variant of C++ called Open C++, in
                  which the programmer can alter the implementation of
                  method calls to obtain new language functionalities
                  suitable for the programmer's applications. This
                  paper also presents a framework called Oc, which is
                  used to help obtain various functionalities for
                  distributed computing on top of Open C++. Because
                  the overhead due to the meta level computation is
                  negligible in distributed computing, this
                  methodology is applicable to practical programming.},

	Abstract = {Mothra is a software test environment that supports
                  mutation-based testing of software systems. Mutation
                  analysis is a powerful software testing technique
                  that evaluates the adequacy of test data based on
                  its ability to differentiate between the program
                  under test and its mutants, where mutants are
                  constructed by inserting single, simple errors into
                  the program under test. This evaluation process also
                  provides guidance in the creation of new test cases
                  to provide more adequate testing. Mothra consists of
                  a collection of individual tools, each of which
                  implements a separate, independent function for the
                  testing system. The initial Mothra tool set, for the
                  most part, duplicates functionality existing in
                  previous mutation analysis systems. Current efforts
                  are concentrated on extending this basic tool set to
                  include capabilities previously unavailable to the
                  software testing community. The authors describe
                  Mothra tool set and extensions planned for the

                  has been implemented on a variety of architectures,
                  and in combination with several sequential
                  languages, its formal semantics is relatively
                  unexplored. In this paper we study and compare a
                  number of operational semantics specifications for
                  Linda: Plotkin's SOS, Milner's CCS, Petri Nets, and
                  Berry and Boudol's Chemical Abstract Machine. We
                  analyze these specifications, and show how they

	Abstract = {Schema evolution support is an important facility
                  for object-oriented database (OODB) systems. While
                  existing OODB systems provide for limited forms of
                  evolution, including modification to the database
                  schema and reorganization of affected instances, we
                  find their support insufficient. Specific
                  deficiencies are 1) the lack of compatibility
                  support for old applications, and 2) the lack of
                  ability to install arbitrary changes upon the schema
                  and database. This paper examines the limitations of
                  existing schemes, and offers a more general
                  framework for specifying and reasoning about the
                  evolution of class definitions and the adaptation of
                  existing, persistent instances to those new

                  existing databases to be adjusted for varying roles
                  over time. This paper reflects on existing evolution
                  support schemes and introduces a more general and
                  functional mechanism to support schema evolution and
                  \fIinstance adaptation\fP for centralized and
                  distributed object-oriented database systems. Our
                  evolution support scheme is distinguished from
                  previous mechanisms in that it is primarily
                  concerned with preserving existing database objects
                  and maintaining compatibility for old applications,
                  while permitting a wider range of evolution
                  operations. It achieves this by supporting schema
                  versioning, allowing multiple representations of
                  instances to persist simultaneously, and providing
                  for programmer specification of how to adapt
                  existing instances. The mechanism is general enough
                  to provide much of the support necessarily for

	Abstract = {A key component in a reuse-oriented software
                  development environment is an appropriate software
                  repository. We present a repository system which
                  supports the entire software development lifecycle,
                  providing for the integrated and consistent
                  representation, organization, storage, and
                  management of reusable artefacts. The system can
                  support multiple development and representation
                  models and is dynamically adaptable to new ones. The
                  chapter focuses on the facilities offered by the
                  system for component classification, an important
                  technique for retrieving reusable software. It is
                  demonstrated that the inherently delicate and
                  complex process of classification is streamlined and
                  considerably facilitated by integrating it into a
                  wider documentation environment and, especially, by
                  connecting it with software static analysis. The
                  benefits in terms of precision, consistency and ease
                  of use can be significant for large scale
                  applications.},

	Abstract = {Open Distributed Systems are the dominating
                  intellectual issue of the research in distributed
                  systems. Figuring out how to build and maintain
                  those systems becomes a central issue in distributed
                  systems research today. Although CORBA seems to
                  provide all the necessary support to the
                  construction of those systems, CORBA provides a very
                  limited support to the evolution of their
                  requirements. The main problem is that the
                  description of the elements from which the systems
                  are built, and the way in which they are composed
                  are mixed into the application code, making systems
                  difficult to understand, modify and customize. A
                  possible solution to this problem goes through the
                  introduction of the so-called coordination models
                  and languages into the CORBA model. We propose in
                  this paper a coordination programming system called
                  CORODS which introduces the CoLaSD coordination
                  model and language into the CORBA model. CoLaSD is a
                  coordination model based on the notion of
                  Coordination Groups, entities that specify, control
                  and enforces the coordination of groups of
                  collaborating active objects.},

                  common tasks. Cooperative Object Information Systems
                  are systems constrained to continuously adapt to new
                  requirements: new objects are introduced into the
                  systems, cooperation protocols change, etc. Building
                  Cooperative Object Information Systems is difficult
                  because most of the concurrent and distributed
                  object oriented programming languages and frameworks

                  their specification and abstraction, making them

                  by the specification of rules governing the
                  coordination. No model, including our CoLaS

                  their coordination rules. Why these rules and not

                  that remain still open. In order to try to provide

	Abstract = {We propose in this thesis the use of active objects
                  and coordination models and languages for the
                  specification and construction of concurrent
                  object-oriented systems. Active objects are objects
                  integrating concurrency and coordination models and
                  languages are models and languages that specify the
                  way the active objects composing the systems are
                  glued together. Our approach is based on the
                  definition of a coordination model and language
                  called CoLaS for the specification of the
                  coordination aspect in concurrent object-oriented
                  systems based on active objects. The CoLaS

	Abstract = {Coordination technology addresses the construction
                  of open, flexible systems from software agents in
                  distributed systems. Most of the work on
                  coordination technology so far has focussed on the
                  development of special coordination languages and
                  environments that provide the basic mechanisms for
                  realizing the coordination layer of a distributed
                  application. Typically each new language proposes
                  its own set of coordination abstractions that
                  realizes a particular paradigm for realizing
                  coordination. Coordination problems, however, are
                  not always well-suited to a particular paradigm.
                  Instead of proposing a new language, we are
                  attempting to develop an open set of software
                  components that realize various useful coordination
                  abstractions. We are validating our approach by
                  developing an experimental framework of coordination
                  components in {Java} and applying them to a
                  canonical set of sample applications. We present our
                  initial analysis of the coordination domain, and
                  give a few examples of simple applications using the
                  developed coordination components.},

                  particular paradigm for realizing coordination.
                  Coordination problems, however are not always
                  well-suited to a particular paradigm. Instead of
                  proposing a language, we propose to realize a set of
                  coordination components that realize useful
                  coordination abstractions. We argue in this paper
                  that this approach can be applied to the development

	Abstract = {Most of the work on coordination technology so far
                  has focused on the development of special
                  coordination languages and environments that provide
                  the basic mechanisms for realizing the coordination
                  layer of an open system. It is clear that the idea
                  of managing separately the coordination aspect from
                  the computation in a language has a lot of
                  advantages in the development of those systems.
                  Nevertheless, most of the coordination languages do
                  not take care that additionally to managing
                  coordination requirements, they must manage other
                  kinds of "openness" related requirements in Open
                  Systems. The most important requirement being to
                  support the evolution of the coordination
                  requirements themselves. This problem manifests
                  during the software development process by the
                  development over and over again of solutions to
                  similar coordination problems. To tackle this
                  problem, and instead of proposing a new language, we
                  are attempting to develop an open set of adaptable
                  and reusable software components that realize
                  various useful coordination abstractions. With these
                  components we provide explicit separation of
                  coordination from computation, and facilitate reuse
                  and evolution of coordination aspects in Open
                  Systems.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that the current OO technology
                  does not support reuse and configurability in an
                  effective way. This problem can be addressed by
                  augmenting OO analysis and design with feature
                  modeling and by applying generative implementation
                  techniques. Feature modeling allows capturing the
                  variability of domain concepts. Concrete concept
                  instances can then be synthesized from abstract
                  specifications. Using a simple example of a
                  configurable list component, we demonstrate the
                  application of feature modeling and how to implement
                  a feature model as a generator. We introduce the
                  concepts of configuration repositories and
                  configuration generators and show how to implement
                  them using object-oriented, generic, and generative
                  language mechanisms. The configuration generator
                  utilizes C++ template metaprogramming, which enables
                  its execution at compile-time.},

                  music and other areas often need to deal with
                  concurrent activities with specific temporal

                  facility to help program such applications. This
                  facility provides support for specifying long-term
                  behaviour of objects in an object-oriented
                  environment. Temporal scripts can instantiated and
                  combined using a set of temporal operators, saying
                  for example that two activities begin at the same
                  time, or that one has to follow the other. Through a
                  flexible sampling policy based on a notion of
                  virtual time, temporal specifications can he
                  executed at various temporal resolutions, and

	Abstract = {A new calculus is presented for modelling
                  object-oriented constructs. The main features of the
                  calculus are: interaction by names, unification of
                  types and values, operators for combinations and
                  alternations of terms. With a limited set of
                  syntactic constructs a surprisingly large range of
                  features can be modelled, including not only
                  object-oriented constructs but also abstract data
                  types, recursive and dependent types and
                  concurrency. The syntax and operational semantics of
                  the calculus are presented, together with numerous
                  programming examples. Through comparisons with the
                  lambda calculus, we argue that interaction by names
                  is fundamentally more expressive than traditional
                  functional abstraction and application. In
                  particular, it becomes possible to treat the
                  parameters of an abstraction independently while
                  doing a fixed-point operation, which is of great
                  convenience for modelling object-oriented systems.
                  Finally, an approach to type-checking is presented.
                  Although not totally mature yet, it shows how types
                  and values are merged in a single preorder over
                  terms, and how this preorder can be used to prevent
                  type errors.},

@incollection{Dami95a,
	Abstract = {Subtyping, a fundamental notion for software
                  reusability, establishes a classification of data
                  according to a compatibility relationship. This
                  relationship is usually associated with records.
                  However, compatibility can be defined in other
                  situations, involving for example enumerated types
                  or concrete data types. We argue that the basic
                  requirement for supporting compatibility is an
                  interaction protocol between software components
                  using names instead of positions. Based on this
                  principle, an extension of the lambda calculus is
                  proposed, which combines de Bruijn indices with
                  names. In the extended calculus various subtyping
                  situations mentioned above can be modelled; in
                  particular, records are encoded in a straightforward
                  way. Compatibility is formally defined in terms of
                  an operational lattice based on observation of error
                  generation. Unlike many usual orderings, errors are
                  not identified with divergence; as a matter of fact,
                  both are even opposite since they respectively
                  correspond to the bottom and top elements of the
                  lattice. Finally, we briefly explore a second
                  extension of the calculus, providing meet and join
                  operators through a simple operational definition,
                  and opening interesting perspectives for type
                  checking and concurrency.},

@mastersthesis{DeZa09a,
	Abstract = {External domain specific languages are ubiquitous in
                  computer science. Getting ahold of definitions of
                  these languages and being able to analyze them is
                  difficult. The code has to be parsed and transformed
                  to a model before we can even start to retrieve
                  meaningful information. Often a parser is not openly
                  available or is written in an other language. Hence
                  a developer analyzing the code has to manually
                  figure out the grammar and write his own parser.
                  This thesis will address the problem by automating
                  the grammar and parser retrieval process. The
                  approach uses a combination of Parsing Expression
                  Grammars and Genetic Programming.},

                  such a lattice is valuable for reverse-engineering
                  purposes, in that it helps reason about the
                  interface and structure of the class and find errors
                  in the absence of source code. Our technique can
                  also serve as a heuristic for automatic feature

@techreport{Deme94z,
	Abstract = {Throughout the last years a huge amount of work has
                  been devoted to the definition of hypertext models.
                  Even more resources have been directed towards the
                  domain of virtual (dynamic/ computational)
                  hypertext, among others motivated by the idea of
                  building open systems. Surprisingly enough, almost
                  nobody stressed the role of the underlying model in
                  such virtual systems. That is precisely the aim of
                  this text: to define a general hypertext model that
                  is able to support the notion of virtuality. Our
                  assertion is that the combination of the ancient
                  concepts 'Paths' and 'Warm Links' provide just the
                  extra support needed. Moreover this allows for a
                  model where links are but one of the possible ways
                  to relate nodes. While experimenting with the model,
                  an interesting question arose: do bi-directional
                  links fit into a virtual model ? This paper attempts
                  to answer the question. We chose a constructive
                  approach, because our aim was to create a laboratory
                  where ideas concerning virtual hypertext might be
                  explored. We applied recent viewpoints from the
                  field of software engineering (namely object
                  oriented frameworks and mixins) to assist the
                  iterative design process. In order to show the value
                  of the work, we have implemented two prototype
                  applications. The first is a browser for viewing
                  (Smalltalk) source code which includes query
                  facilities, the second is an electronic agenda.
                  These experiments demonstrate three desired
                  properties of the model: the applicability
                  (considering the differences between the
                  prototypes), the open endedness (since it is able to
                  establish hypertext structures on top of underlying
                  foreign constructions) and the extensibility (while
                  building the applications, we continued to expand
                  the model).},

	Abstract = {Hypermedia technology is a potential benefit for all
                  computer applications that deal with information. To
                  penetrate new markets, hypermedia systems should be
                  tailorable to specific application domains. We claim
                  that an open, extensible hypermedia system is
                  crucial to attain such tailorability. A hypermedia
                  system should be capable to integrate 1) facilities
                  for incorporating vendor-independent document
                  viewers and 2) flexible linking facilities that
                  access external information repositories. This
                  document describes how we extended the Dexter model
                  with the "path" concept, to model hypermedia systems
                  with extensible link engines. We show that paths
                  absorb the notion of links and make it possible to
                  integrate various strategies for resolving links.
                  This proves our claim that "paths end the tyranny of
                  the link". This is demonstrated with a case from the
                  Software Engineering Community: a framework browser.
                  The case involves a hypermedia system that
                  integrates a home-cooked world-wide web browser, an
                  off-the-shelf word processor (Microsoft Word) and a
                  programming environment for Smalltalk (VisualWorks).
                  Besides interpreting embedded (HTML style) anchors,
                  the system is able to query the Smalltalk
                  environment to link documentation to Smalltalk
                  source code. The case serves as a proof of concept
                  that an extensible hypermedia system can penetrate
                  specific application domains.},

                  object-oriented framework represents a design for a
                  family of applications, where variations in the

	Abstract = {The increasing complexity and heterogeneity of
                  modern networks has pushed industry and research
                  towards a single and consistent way of managing
                  networks. The effort to define a single
                  industry-standard API for network management
                  basically failed because it did not address aspects
                  like complexity and ease of programming. Recently, a
                  common approach is to map established network
                  management standards into another object model,
                  often based on the emerging Corba standard.
                  Unfortunately even this approach has shown many
                  drawbacks related primarily to the significant
                  amount of code that has to be linked with the final
                  application and to the many limitations and
                  imperfections of the mapping itself. This paper
                  describes a new approach to inter-domain management
                  that attempts to overcome the limitations of current
                  solutions. The goal is to allow people to write
                  hybrid CMIP and SNMP-based network management
                  applications using a single and simple object model.
                  Relevant characteristics of this approach are that
                  it is light, extensible, object-oriented,
                  language-neutral, built upon software-components,
                  string-syntax based and Internet-ready. This
                  demonstrates that it is feasible to implement simple
                  and light applications for inter-domain management
                  without the need for expensive or complex
                  technologies.},

                  hiding differences between network resources, along
                  with a method of managing them in a consistent way.
                  Frequently, network management tools are based on
                  proprietary products and are often complex both to
                  use and to install. The increasing popularity of the
                  World Wide Web, with its established user interface
                  and the ability to run on almost any platform,
                  offers a new way to provide wide access to complex
                  software applications. This paper describes the
                  architecture and implementation of two new network
                  management applications that are accessible through
                  the web and are targeted to run on powerful hosts as

@inproceedings{Detl99a,
	Abstract = {We discuss aspects of inlining of virtual method
                  invocations. First, we introduce a new method test
                  to guard inlinings of such invocations, with a
                  different set of tradeoffs from the class-equality
                  tests proposed previously in the literature. Second,
                  we consider the problem of inlining virtual methods
                  directly, with no guarding test, in dynamic
                  languages such as Self or the {Java} (TM)
                  programming language, whose semantics prohibit a
                  static identification of the complete set of modules
                  that comprise a program. In non-dynamic languages, a
                  whole-program analysis might prove the correctness
                  of a direct virtual inlining. In dynamic languages,
                  however, such analyses can be invalidated by later
                  class loading, and must therefore be treated as
                  assumptions whose later violation must cause
                  recompilation. In the past, such systems have
                  required an on-stack replacement mechanism to update
                  currently-executing invocations of methods
                  containing invalidated inlinings. This paper
                  presents analyses that allow some virtual calls to
                  be inlined directly, while ensuring that invocations
                  in progress may complete safely even if class
                  loading invalidates the inlining for future
                  invocations. This provides the benefits of direct
                  inlining without the need for on-stack replacement,
                  which can be complicated and require space-consuming
                  data structures.},

                  identification of objects in legacy code take the
                  data structures as starting point for candidate
                  classes. Unfortunately, legacy data structures tend
                  to grow over time, and may contain many unrelated
                  fields at the time of migration. We propose a method
                  for identifying objects by semi-automatically
                  restructuring the legacy data structures. Issues
                  involved include the selection of record fields of
                  interest, the identification of procedures actually
                  dealing with such fields, and the construction of
                  coherent groups of fields and procedures into
                  candidate classes. We explore the use of cluster and
                  concept analysis for the purpose of object
                  identification, and we illustrate their effect on a
                  100,000 LOC Cobol system. Furthermore, we use these
                  results to contrast clustering with concept analysis

                  environment. We also provide a complete description

                  only applications must evolve over time, but the
                  object models themselves may need to be adapted to
                  the requirements of different run-time contexts.
                  Class-based models and prototype-based models, for
                  example, may need to co-exist to meet the demands of
                  dynamically evolving applications. Multi-dimensional
                  dispatch, fine-grained and dynamic software

                  further examples of diverse mechanisms which may

                  reasonable safety guarantees? To this end we present
                  an original calculus in which objects can adapt
                  their behaviour at run-time to changing contexts.
                  Both objects and environments are represented by
                  first-class mappings between variables and values.
                  Message sends are dynamically resolved to method
                  calls. Variables may be dynamically bound, making it
                  possible to model a variety of dynamic mechanisms

                  For each program, we measured as much low level data
                  as possible, including age and size distribution,
                  type distribution, and the overhead of object
                  alignment. Among other things, we found that
                  non-pointer data usually represents more than 50\% of
                  the allocated space for instance objects, that
                  {Java} objects tend to live longer than objects in

	Abstract = {In rapidly evolving domains such as Computer
                  Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) emphasis is
                  often put first on innovation and new functionality,
                  rather than in developing the common infrastructure
                  needed to support integration and reuse of these
                  innovations. In fact, developing such an
                  infrastructure is often considered to be a high-risk
                  venture given the volatility of such a domain. We
                  present CompAS, a method that exploits the very
                  evolution of innovations in the domain to carry out
                  the necessary quantitative and qualitative
                  commonality and variability analysis, especially in
                  the case of scarce system documentation. We show how
                  our technique applies to the CAOS domain by using
                  conference proceedings as a key source of
                  information about the evolution of features in CAOS
                  systems over a period of several years. We detect
                  and classify evolution patterns to determine
                  functional commonality and variability. We also
                  identify non-functional requirements to help capture
                  domain variability. We have validated our approach
                  by evaluating the degree to which representative
                  test systems can be covered by the common and
                  variable features produced by our analysis.},

                  large legacy systems, is a difficult task, because
                  of the sheer size and complexity of the systems.
                  Many approaches have been developed to analyze
                  software systems written in different languages.
                  These approaches employ vary techniques like metrics
                  or visualizations, and typically rely on parsing the
                  system and on extracting a model that conforms to a
                  meta-model. However, no existent meta-model could
                  fulfill the requirements for analyzing Lisp systems,
                  so we developed the FAMIX-Lisp meta-model, as an
                  extension of an existing meta-model. Our FAMIX-Lisp
                  meta-model extends the initial meta-model with
                  capabilities to model Lisp systems by adding new
                  entities that are unique to Lisp, like Macros and
                  CLOS entities. Software visualization has been
                  widely used by the reverse engineering research
                  community during the past two decades, becoming one
                  of the major approaches in reverse engineering. In
                  our thesis we also propose a set of new
                  visualizations for Lisp systems, developed to
                  underline the differences of the language and to
                  help understand and browse complex Lisp systems,
                  namely: (1) The Class-Method Relation View is a
                  visual way of supporting the understanding of the
                  relation between classes and methods in a
                  object-oriented Lisp program; (2) The Class Types
                  View is a visual way of identifying different types
                  of classes, based on their structure (the attributes
                  to methods ratio); (3) The Programming Style
                  Distribution View is a visual way of identifying the
                  programming paradigm used in a program and their
                  distribution over the system's packages; (4) The
                  Generic Concerns View is a visual way of identifying
                  different cross-cutting concerns in a system by
                  visualizing the spread of generic functions in the
                  system. The target of our views is to visualize very
                  large Lisp systems, for which we want to obtain an
                  initial understanding of their structure and their
                  properties, which helps to guide software developers
                  in the first steps of the reverse engineering
                  process of an unknown system.},

	Abstract = {Many reverse engineering approaches have been
                  developed to analyze software systems written in
                  different languages like C/C++ or Java. These
                  approaches typically rely on a meta-model, that is
                  either specific for the language at hand or language
                  independent (e.g. UML). However, one language that
                  was hardly addressed is Lisp. While at first sight
                  it can be accommodated by current language
                  independent meta-models, Lisp has some unique
                  features (e.g. macros, CLOS entities) that are
                  crucial for reverse engineering Lisp systems. In
                  this paper we propose a suite of new visualizations
                  that reveal the special traits of the Lisp language
                  and thus help in understanding complex Lisp systems.
                  To validate our approach we apply them on several
                  large Lisp case studies, and summarize our
                  experience in terms of a series of recurring visual
                  patterns that we have detected.},

                  systems. The specification describes the system as a
                  society of `agents', each of them being
                  characterised (i) by its responsibility with respect
                  to actions happening in the system and (ii) by its
                  time-varying perception of the behaviour of the
                  other agents. On top of the language, we also
                  suggest some methodological guidance by considering
                  a general strategy based on a progressive

	Abstract = {Abstraction is a fundamental concept in software
                  engineering. In this paper, we describe how
                  object-oriented technology can be applied to provide
                  a class of abstractions, called coordination
                  abstractions, that can simplify the construction of
                  parallel software. Coordination abstractions capture
                  communication, synchronization and topological
                  information about parallel computations.
                  Abstractions can be defined that provide support for
                  a surprisingly broad range of parallel applications
                  which share a common underlying coordination
                  structure. We demonstrate this by describing the
                  design and implementation of a coordination
                  abstraction in {Java} and its application to the
                  solution of selected parallel computing problems.},

	Abstract = {Software is intangible and the knowledge about a
                  software system and its architecture is often
                  implicit. Thus the developers'mental model of their
                  software system is an important factor in software
                  engineering. We want to provide developers, and
                  everyone else involved in software development, with
                  a shared, spatial and stable mental model of their
                  software project. We aim to reinforce this by
                  embedding a cartographic visualization in the IDE
                  (Integrated Development Environment). The
                  visualization is always visible in the IDE, similar
                  to the overview map found in many computer games.
                  For each development task, related information is
                  displayed on the map. In this thesis we present
                  Codemap, an Eclipse plug-in that demonstrates the
                  use of software cartography in the context of an
                  IDE. We perform an informal user study to validate
                  our assumptions about the usage of Codemap.},

		 method dispatch mechanisms by permitting arbitrary
		 predicates to control method applicability and by using
		 logical implication between predicates as the
		 overriding relationship. The method selected to handle
		 a message send can depend not just on the classes of
		 the arguments, as in ordinary object-oriented dispatch,
		 but also on the classes of the arguments, as in
		 ordinary object-oriented dispatch, but also on the
		 classes of subcomponents, on an argument's state, and
		 on relationships between objects. This simple mechanism
		 subsumes and extends object-oriented single and
		 multiple dispatch, ML-style pattern matching, predicate
		 classes, and classifiers, which can all be regarded as
		 syntactic sugar for predicate dispatching. This paper
		 introduces predicate dispatching, gives motivating
		 examples, and presents its static and dynamic
		 semantics. An implementation of predicate dispatching

@inproceedings{Erns99a,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a mixin based class and method
                  combination mechanism with block structure
                  propagation. Traditionally, mixins can be composed
                  to form new classes, possibly merging the
                  implementations of methods (as in CLOS). In our
                  approach, a class or method combination operation
                  may cause any number of implicit combinations. For
                  example, it is possible to specify separate aspects
                  of a family of classes, and then combine several
                  aspects into a full-fledged class family. The
                  combination expressions would explicitly combine
                  whole-family aspects, and by propagation implicitly
                  combine the aspects for each member of the class
                  family, and again by propagation implicitly compose
                  each method from its aspects. As opposed to CLOS,
                  this is type-checked statically; and as opposed to
                  other systems for advanced class

	Abstract = {Well adapted to the loosely coupled nature of
                  distributed interaction in large-scale applications,
                  the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has
                  recently received increasing attention. With systems
                  based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme,
                  subscribers register their interest in an event, or
                  a pattern of events, and are subsequently
                  asynchronously notified of events generated by
                  publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have
                  recently been proposed, each variant being
                  specifically adapted to some given application or
                  network model. This paper factors out the common
                  denominator underlying these variants: full
                  decoupling of the communicating entities in time,
                  space, and synchronization. We use these three
                  decoupling dimensions to better identify
                  commonalities and divergences with traditional
                  interaction paradigms. The many variations on the
                  theme of publish/subscribe are classified and
                  synthesized. In particular, their respective
                  benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in
                  terms of interfaces and implementations.},

	Abstract = {A major aim of transactional distributed programming
                  environments is to facilitate the development of
                  reliable distributed applications by shielding the
                  developer from concerns such as failures. This paper
                  describes the linguistic features of the Hermes/ST
                  object-oriented distributed programming environment
                  that further ease the development of such
                  applications by enhancing the flexibility and
                  extendibility of their implementations. This is
                  achieved through the parameterisation of properties
                  such as permanence, concurrency, transactional
                  semantics and distribution. Parameterisation
                  supports reuse, and enables the notion of
                  incremental development, whereby a simple
                  centralized sequential prototype of the application
                  can be easily validated before being gradually
                  extended to the final efficient reliable distributed
                  application. An example application is included to
                  demonstrate this approach.},

                  dynamic data in a well-defined format. Java Wiretap
                  captures fine-grained dynamic data such as message
                  semds (activations), field access and instance
                  tracking. The extracted model can then be used by a

@mastersthesis{Fier09a,
	Abstract = {Debugging object-oriented programs often is a
                  difficult and time-consuming task. Nearly all of
                  today's debuggers only show the current state of a
                  failing program. The user can see when the state is
                  corrupted, but usually the root cause that leads to
                  that state occurs long before that. Back-in-time
                  debuggers address this problem by recording the
                  execution history of a program run and presenting it
                  to the user for inspection of past states. Those
                  debuggers have proven useful as they help the
                  developer to solve difficult problems better than a
                  standard debugger. However, most of those tools do
                  not provide sophisticated techniques to explore the
                  collected dynamic data, which can make it hard to
                  track down the root cause of an error in large
                  program executions. The approaches are
                  state-centric, which means they provide the past
                  state at different points in time, but they provide
                  no information on how objects were passed around in
                  the system. To address this problem we provide a
                  flow-centric approach that focuses on the reference
                  transfers of objects. We present a new back-in-time
                  debugger user interface that provides more efficient
                  exploration of the execution history. The debugger
                  has views and functionality that help the developer
                  understand the failing system and let him explore
                  how objects were passed around. Our initial case
                  studies show that it is possible to find complex
                  bugs more efficiently than with existing
                  approaches.},

	Abstract = {The Marmot system is a research platform for studying the implementation of high level programming languages. It currently comprises an optimizing native-code compiler, runtime system, and libraries for a large subset of Java. Marmot integrates well-known representation, optimization, code generation, and runtime techniques with a few Java-specific features to achieve competitive performance.
This paper contains a description of the Marmot system design, along with highlights of our experience applying and adapting traditional implementation techniques to Java. A detailed performance evaluation assesses both Marmot's overall performance relative to other Java and C++ implementations and the relative costs of various Java language features in Marmot-compiled code.
Our experience with Marmot has demonstrated that well-known compilation techniques can produce very good performance for static Java applications---comparable or superior to other Java systems, and approaching that of C++ in some cases.},

                  computer animation. Since the pieces of an animation
                  can come from various media such as
                  computer-generated imagery, video, and sound, the
                  case for object orientation is all the stronger.
                  However, languages for expressing the temporal
                  co-ordination of animated objects have been slow in
                  coming. We present such a language in this paper.
                  Since the movements that an animated object can
                  perform are also encapsulated as objects in our
                  system, the scripting language can also be used to
                  specify motion co-ordination. Such "motion objects"
                  can be applied to any animated object. The syntax,
                  semantics, and implementation of this language will
                  be described, and we shall show how to specify
                  device-independent computer animation.},

                  This architectural convergence is affecting the

	Abstract = {The power of high-level languages lies in their abstraction over hardware and software complexity, leading to greater security, better reliability, and lower development costs. However, opaque abstractions are often show-stoppers for systems programmers, forcing them to either break the abstraction, or more often, simply give up and use a different language. This paper addresses the challenge of opening up a high-level language to allow practical low-level programming without forsaking integrity or performance. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) we draw together common threads in a diverse literature, 2) we identify a framework for extending high-level languages for low-level programming, and 3) we show the power of this approach through concrete case studies. Our framework leverages just three core ideas: extending semantics via intrinsic methods, extending types via unboxing and architectural-width primitives, and controlling semantics via scoped semantic regimes. We develop these ideas through the context of a rich literature and substantial practical experience. We show that they provide the power necessary to implement substantial artifacts such as a high-performance virtual machine, while preserving the software engineering benefits of the host language. The time has come for high-level low-level programming to be taken more seriously: 1) more projects now use high-level languages for systems programming, 2) increasing architectural heterogeneity and parallelism heighten the need for abstraction, and 3) a new generation of high-level languages are under development and ripe to be influenced.},

	Abstract = {This diploma work examines the MAINTENANCE OF
                  TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION within an software
                  engineering process. The characteristics of
                  technical documentation and its behaviour within an
                  dynamic software development environment are
                  important to understand the problems that occur with
                  technical documentation. I explore the factors that
                  influence the development and the resulting quality
                  of the technical docu-mentation. The RELATIONSHIP
                  BETWEEN SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE AND TECHNICAL
                  DOC-UMENTATION is used to coordinate the development
                  of the technical documentation with the software
                  development. The principle to match software entity
                  names with documentation segments defines the
                  relationship between software and documenta-tion. I
                  demonstrate how it works and how it is used for
                  coordination of the software development and the
                  technical documentation development. An analysis of
                  different name representations and documentation
                  segmentation structures shows the influence of the
                  structures on the creation of relations. I explore
                  under which conditions relations are generated that
                  fit best to the relationship between software and
                  documentation that exists in reality. The
                  ASSOCIATIVE DOCUMENTATION MODEL (ADM) builds on the
                  relationship between software and documentation that
                  is determined by matching of software en-tity names
                  within documentation. The ADM focuses on three
                  aspects: It concentrates on the extraction of the
                  names of software entities. ADM uses Famix models
                  that are capable to represent any object-oriented
                  software and detects the software entities to be
                  represented by their names. Additionally, ADM
                  considers structural relationships between the
                  software entities that are given by inheritance,
                  aggregation, invocation and access. The second
                  aspect is the representation of the relationship
                  between software and documentation. Especially the
                  influence of the inner relationship of software
                  en-tities on the relationship between software and
                  documentation is important. The third aspect is to
                  get the detection of the software entity names and
                  the generation of the relationship between software
                  and documentation into a consistent model. It serves
                  as a uniform model of the software-documentation
                  relationship for any application that uses this
                  model. CHANGE IMPACT DETECTION is an sample
                  application of the ADM. It determines changes
                  between two software versions by comparison of the
                  models of these versions. Differences between the
                  models are interpreted as changes. The names of the
                  entities that are affected by the changes are taken
                  as representations of the changes. The ADM relates
                  these change representations to the documentation.
                  This way, impact of the software changes on the
                  documentation is detected over the ADM relations.

	Abstract = {In the context of the FAMOOS project it is necessary
                  to transfer object-oriented models of software
                  systems between different analysis tools. These
                  models conform to the meta-model FAMIX, which is a
                  model of the source code of a software system. In
                  this project the OMG standard XMI (XML Metadata
                  Interchange) is used to map the FAMIX meta-model to
                  an XML DTD and generate XML files based on the model
                  that is transferred. Because XMI is based on MOF
                  (Meta Object Facility) meta-models, FAMIX is defined
                  as a MOF meta-model. Based on these concepts, a
                  prototype in Java is implemented that reads data
                  from the Java reflective-interface and uses the XMI
                  standard to generate an XML document. Because any
                  model that has a MOF compliant metamodel can be
                  exchanged with XMI, the prototype uses a generic
                  approach by implementing the MOF interfaces and
                  instantiating the FAMIX meta-model from the MOF
                  model. This architecture can be reused for systems
                  that use meta-models different from FAMIX. In order
                  to test the correctness of the model-data after the
                  transfer, a test program is implemented, that
                  verifies the syntax and the content of generated XMI
                  documents.},

	Abstract = {Testing the behavior of object-oriented systems is
                  an important activity in the software development
                  and maintenance process. It validates an expected
                  behavior against an observed behavior. A behavioral
                  test is an assertion over a set of messages and
                  objects states that occur during the execution of a
                  system. Testing behavior is especially important for
                  object-oriented legacy systems where current
                  behavior is the only thing we can trust because a
                  specification is often missing. There are two
                  problems with testing behavior of object-oriented
                  systems. First there exists no common form to
                  express a hypothesis about an expected behavior and
                  to validate it against an actual program behavior.
                  This has the consequence that behavioral tests are
                  carried out manually by stepping through an
                  execution with a debugger and asserting behavioral
                  properties by visually inspecting states, arguments
                  and messages in the context of the execution history
                  of the system. Second it is a priori not clear what
                  kind of behavior should be tested and how it is
                  represented in terms of message passing and state
                  changes. This causes additional friction when
                  setting up tests for behaviors that occur over and
                  over again in different systems. In this thesis the
                  concept of trace-based object-oriented testing is
                  introduced. It supports the specification of an
                  expected behavior in the form of a formal expression
                  and an automatic test of whether an expected
                  behavior occurs in previously recorded execution
                  trace. A prototype tool TESTLOG on the basis of the
                  logic language SOUL is developed that supports
                  trace-based object-oriented testing in the form of a
                  logic query over a trace. As a validation of the
                  concept behavioral tests for different types of
                  behaviors that frequently occur in object-oriented
                  systems are designed and documented in the form of a
                  pattern language. The use of the computational power
                  of a logic language for behavioral testing solves
                  the problem of automatically identifying if an
                  expected behavior occurs in an execution trace. A
                  set of predefined logic rules serves as a language
                  to compose complex behavioral tests such that a
                  tester can take advantage of the intrinsic rule
                  abstraction facility of SOUL. In order to identify
                  recurring behavioral concepts we classify behavior
                  and try to abstract general purpose templates for
                  different types of behavior in order to obtain
                  reusable behavioral test artifacts.},

	Abstract = {When building a software system, software developers
                  each contribute a flow of information that together
                  forms the system. As they work, developers
                  continuously consult various fragments of
                  information to answer their questions about the
                  system. In today's programming environments,
                  information is kept in disparate silos, such as
                  program code, bugs and change sets. However, to
                  answer the variety of questions a developer faces,
                  the interleaving of information from multiple

                  our analysis is that inheritance of synchronization
                  constraints should take the form of incrementally
                  {\em more} restrictive constraints for derived
                  subclasses. Our conclusion is based on the view that
                  combinations of behavior in object-oriented
                  languages yield subclasses that {\em extend}
                  superclass behavior. We give a notation for
                  describing synchronization constraints. In our
                  notation, synchronization constraints can be
                  inherited and aggregated. We present a number of
                  examples that illustrate the fundamental concepts
                  captured by our notation. Synchronization
                  constraints are described as restrictions that apply
                  to invocation of methods. Application of
                  restrictions is {\em pattern-based}, which allows
                  the same restriction to apply to multiple methods

                  expression of multi-object coordination. In our
                  language, coordination patterns can be specified
                  abstractly, independent of the protocols needed to
                  implement them. Coordination patterns are expressed
                  in the form of constraints that restrict invocation
                  of a group of objects. Constraints are defined in
                  terms of the interface of the objects being invoked
                  rather than their internal representation.
                  Invocation constraints enforce properties, such as
                  temporal ordering and atomicity, that hold when
                  invoking objects in a group. A constraint can
                  permanently control access to a group of objects,
                  thereby expressing an inherent access restriction
                  associated with the group. Furthermore, a constraint
                  can temporarily enforce access restrictions during
                  the activity of individual clients. In that way,
                  constraints can express specialized access schemes

                  for distributed systems is to provide abstractions
                  for coordination. A common type of coordination
                  requires reactivity in response to arbitrary
                  communication patterns. We have developed a
                  communication model in which concurrent objects can

                  common interaction patterns found in concurrent
                  systems. For example, the model captures multiple
                  clients that collectively invoke shared servers as a
                  single activation. Furthermore, it supports

                  Environment based on a Software Information System

                  components and artifacts about development of these
                  components. Object-oriented techniques are used in
                  the Environment at all levels of the development of
                  an application: requirement specification,
                  scripting, implementation through class refinement
                  and tailoring. In the Environment, it is tracked how
                  the various products of the development phases were
                  produced by providing tools for the Application
                  Engineer who is responsible for abstracting

	Abstract = {A single software fault may cause several tests to
                  break, if they cover the same methods. The coverage
                  sets of tests may not just overlap, but include one
                  another. This information could be of great use to
                  developers who would like to focus on the most
                  specific test that concerns a given fault.
                  Unfortunately, existing unit testing tools neither
                  gather nor exploit this information. We have
                  developed a simple approach that analyses a set of
                  test suites, and infers the partial order
                  corresponding to inclusion hierarchy of the coverage
                  sets. When several tests in an inclusion chain
                  break, we can guide the developer to the most
                  specific test in the chain. Our first experiments
                  with three case studies suggest that most unit tests
                  for typical applications are, in fact, comparable to
                  other tests, and can therefore be partially ordered.
                  Furthermore, we show that this partial order is
                  semantically meaningful, since faults that cause a
                  test to break will, in nearly all cases cause less
                  specific tests too break too.},

	Abstract = {Not all unit tests are alike. Some tests are simple
                  one-liners, while others contain a battery of
                  assertions. Certain tests focus on a single method,
                  while others test interactions between methods.
                  There are even tests that do not contain assertions
                  at all. This can make it difficult for a developer
                  to understand which methods are tested by which
                  tests, to what degree they are tested, and what to
                  take into account while refactoring. We have
                  manually analyzed the test base of a large existing
                  object-oriented system in order to derive a first
                  taxonomy of unit tests. We have then developed some
                  simple tools to semi-automatically categorize tests
                  according to this taxonomy, and applied it to two
                  case studies. Beside explaining our taxonomy, we
                  report on our initial results using it, namely that
                  a majority of unit tests focus on single methods and
                  that our lightweight automatic categorization could
                  already classify more than 50\% of these single
                  method commands.},

	Abstract = {If we were to apply the testing techniques of
                  object-oriented systems prescribed by the XUnit
                  framework to a car factory, the result would be an
                  inefficient process: A tire would be created,
                  quality assured and then thrown away, only to be
                  recreated later to test the functionality of the
                  whole car. XUnit makes it difficult to reuse
                  intermediate results of low level unit tests. As a
                  consequence a higher level unit test is forced to
                  recreate test scenarios which were already created
                  by lower level unit tests. This duplicated testing
                  effort is time-consuming both for setting up new
                  scenarios and for running the tests. To address this
                  problem we suggest a semi-automatic approach to
                  compose tests. First we describe how we can detect
                  candidates of composable test cases by partially
                  ordering their sets of covered method signatures,
                  then we present techniques to refactor unit tests
                  accordingly.},

	Abstract = {Creating ones own games has been the main motiva-
                  tion for many people to learn programming. But the
                  barrier to learn a general purpose programming
                  language is very high, especially if some positive
                  results can only be expected after having manually
                  written more than 100 lines of code. With this paper
                  we first motivate potential users by showing that
                  one can create classic board- and arcade games like
                  Lights Out, TicTacToe, or Pacman within the playful
                  and constructivist visual learning environment Etoys
                  dragging together only a few lines of code. Then we
                  present recurring idioms which helped to develop
                  these games with only a few lines of code.},

@phdthesis{Gael06b,
	Abstract = {One of the oldest techniques to explain abstract
                  concepts is to provide concrete examples. By
                  explaining an abstract concept with a concrete
                  example people make sure that the concept is
                  understood and remembered. Examples in software can
                  be used both to test the software and to illustrate
                  its functionality. Object-oriented programs are
                  built around the concepts of classes, methods and
                  variables, where methods are the atoms of the
                  functionality. But the meta-models of
                  object-oriented languages do not allow developers to
                  associate runnable and composable examples with
                  these concepts and particularly not with methods.
                  Unit tests on the other hand, assure the quality of
                  the units under test and document them. Not being
                  integrated into the language, unit tests are not
                  linked explicitly to their units under test which
                  makes it unnecessarily dif ficult to use them for
                  documenting, typing and debugging software. In
                  addition they are not composable making it hard to
                  develop higher level test scenarios in parallel with
                  higher level objects. In this thesis we analyze unit
                  tests to learn about implicit dependencies among
                  tests and from tests to the methods under test. We
                  develop a technique to partially order unit tests in
                  terms of their covered methods, which reveals
                  possible redundancies due to the lack of
                  composability. We show how partial orders can be
                  used to debug and to comprehend software. We then
                  develop a taxonomy based on several case studies
                  revealing that a high fraction of unit tests already
                  implicitly focuses on single methods. We show that
                  the rest of the tests can be decomposed into
                  commands focusing on single methods. We build a
                  meta-model based on our findings of analyzing test
                  interdependencies which establishes how tests can be
                  explicitly linked to their method under test and how
                  they can be composed to form higher-level test
                  scenarios. We explain how the problems of missing
                  links between tests and units under test are solved
                  using our meta-model. Furthermore, we implemented
                  the meta-model and a first user interface on top of
                  it to give first evidence of how our model supports
                  the developer.},

	Abstract = {Understanding and maintaining complex software
                  systems is a difficult task. In principle, tests can
                  be a good source of information about how the system
                  works. Unfortunately, tests are frequently
                  unstructured and disconnected from each other and
                  from their units under test. We propose a new
                  approach to organizing unit tests in which tests
                  produce examples of their units under tests which
                  also can be reused for composing higher-level tests.
                  The approach is based on the Eg meta-model, which
                  classifies tests according to their granularity and
                  their goals. We have developed the EgBrowser, an
                  experimental tool for specifying tests that conform
                  to the Eg metamodel while keeping track of the
                  connection between tests themselves and their units
                  under test. Initial usability studies suggest that
                  the approach is both easy to learn and more
                  efficient than the programmatic approach to
                  developing tests.},

                  in object-oriented design. They capture the intent

                  collaborations, and the distribution of
                  responsibilities. Design patterns play many roles in
                  the object-oriented development process: they

                  using the equational framework of Misra. In contrast
                  to other Object Oriented modeling notations,
                  ObjChart uses object decomposition as the single
                  refinement paradigm, maintains orthogonality between
                  control flow and value propagation, introduces
                  Sequence object which embodies structural induction,
                  and allows tracing causality chains in time linear
                  in the size of the system. ObjChart's minimality of
                  notations and precise semantics make ObjChart models
                  of systems coherent and executable.},

	Abstract = {GARF is an object-oriented programming environment
                  aimed to support the design of reliable distributed
                  applications. Its computational model is based on
                  two programming levels: the functional level and the
                  behavioral level. At the functional level, software
                  functionalities are described using passive objects,
                  named data objects, in a centralized, volatile, and
                  failure free environment. At the behavioral level,
                  data objects are dynamically bound to encapsulators
                  and mailers which support distribution, concurrency,
                  persistence and fault tolerance. Encapsulators wrap
                  data objects by controlling how the latter send and
                  receive messages, while mailers perform
                  communications between encapsulators. This paper
                  describes how the GARF computational model enables
                  to build flexible and highly modular abstractions
                  for the design of reliable distributed
                  applications.},

	Abstract = {CORBA (The Common Object Request Broker
                  Architecture) has to continually evolve in order to
                  cope with the changes of requirement of applications
                  which become larger and more distributed. For this
                  reason new features are being added to the CORBA
                  specification, for instance the last proposal for a
                  revised CORBA Messaging Service includes two new
                  asynchronous models of request invocation. Since
                  these new features will be added in the next CORBA
                  implementations a relevant issue is to study their
                  operational behaviour from different perspectives in
                  order to facilitate the task of implementors. This
                  paper addresses this issue providing an analysis of
                  the CORBA Messaging Service which includes the new
                  asynchronous features. In particular we illustrate
                  how CORBA models for request invocation can be
                  mapped into a message passing architecture based on
                  the actor model. For this purpose we exploit an
                  algebra of actors which supports some of the main
                  features of the abstract Object Model of the Object
                  Management Group, such as object identity and an
                  explicit notion of state. This approach allows us to
                  discuss and compare different models of request
                  invocation in a standard process algebraic
                  perspective for instance we show how different
                  notions of equivalence, such as standard and
                  asynchronous bisimulation, can be adapted to reason
                  about CORBA.},

                  different things assembled from the same components.
                  COP allows things that OOP cannot do, for example,
                  COP enables us to use late binding for elementary

                  software failure. To make the most of this technique
                  the test code should evolve simultaneously with the
                  product code. First, this dissertation explores the
                  possibilities of using dynamic analysis to extract
                  test dependencies. Then we investigate whether
                  heuristic metrics on these dynamic test dependencies
                  provide a measure for the degree to which the test
                  code evolves with the product code. As a case study
                  we use Apache Ant and look specifically at two
                  different phases in the history of this open source

	Abstract = {Software is more and more becoming the major cost
                  factor for embedded devices. Already today, software
                  accounts for more than 50 percent of the development
                  costs of such a device. However, software
                  development practices in this area lag far behind
                  those in the traditional software industry. Reuse is
                  hardly ever heard of in some areas, development from
                  scratch is common practice and component-based
                  software is usually a foreign word. PECOS is a
                  collaborative project between industrial and
                  research partners that seeks to enable
                  component-based technology for a certain class of
                  embedded systems known as "field devices" by taking
                  into account the specific properties of this
                  application area. In this paper we introduce a
                  component model for field device software.
                  Furthermore we report on the PECOS component
                  composition language CoCo and the mapping from CoCo
                  to {Java} and C++.},

                  important in the domain of local area networks (LAN)
                  and wide area networks (WAN). Different kinds of
                  mobile entities are a rapidly evolving area of
                  research in the field of World-Wide-Web, distributed
                  and open systems. The first part of this thesis
                  surveys different approaches in order to develop
                  open, flexible and distributed systems. We focus on
                  an approach of stateless mobile software entities.
                  The second part of this thesis introduces the notion
                  "fruitlet" and "run-time framework" and classifies
                  "fruitlet" within other existing mobility meanings
                  and compares them with other concepts related to
                  mobile code. We describe a prototype of a basic
                  software architecture for stateless mobile software
                  entities. The third part shows examples of open,

@phdthesis{Girb05d,
	Abstract = {Over the past three decades, more and more research
                  has been spent on understanding software evolution.
                  The development and spread of versioning systems
                  made valuable data available for study. Indeed,
                  versioning systems provide rich information for
                  analyzing software evolution, but it is exactly the
                  richness of the information that raises the problem.
                  The more versions we consider, the more data we have
                  at hand. The more data we have at hand, the more
                  techniques we need to employ to analyze it. The more
                  techniques we need, the more generic the
                  infrastructure should be. The approaches developed
                  so far rely on ad-hoc models, or on too specific
                  meta-models, and thus, it is difficult to reuse or
                  compare their results. We argue for the need of an
                  explicit and generic meta-model for allowing the
                  expression and combination of software evolution
                  analyses. We review the state-of-the-art in software
                  evolution analysis and we conclude that: \emph{To
                  provide a generic meta-model for expressing software
                  evolution analyses, we need to recognize the
                  evolution as an explicit phenomenon and model it as
                  a first class entity.} Our solution is to
                  encapsulate the evolution in the explicit notion of
                  history as a sequence of versions, and to build a
                  meta-model around these notions: Hismo. To show the
                  usefulness of our meta-model we exercise its dif
                  ferent characteristics by building several reverse
                  engineering applications. This dissertation of fers
                  a meta-model for software evolution analysis yet,
                  the concepts of history and version do not
                  necessarily depend on software. We show how the
                  concept of history can be generalized and how we can
                  obtain our meta-model by transformations applied on
                  structural meta-models. As a consequence, our
                  approach of modeling evolution is not restricted to
                  software analysis, but can be applied to other
                  fields as well.},

                  discipline. Software engineering, however, is not
                  considered a classical engineering activity for
                  several reasons, such as intrinsic complexity and
                  lack of rigor. In general, if a software system is
                  delivering the expected functionality, only in few
                  cases people see the need to analyze the internals.
                  In this tutorial we offer a pragmatic approach to
                  analyzing the quality of software systems. On the
                  one hand, we offer the theoretical background to
                  detect quality problems by using and combining
                  metrics, by analyzing the past through evolution
                  analysis, and by providing visual evidence of the
                  state of affairs in the system. On the other hand,
                  as analyzing real systems requires adequate tool
                  support, we offer an overview of the problems that
                  occur in using such tools and provide a hands-on

	Abstract = {Code duplication is one of the factors that severely
                  complicates the maintenance and evolution of large
                  software systems. Tools exist that allow detection
                  of duplicated code. Technics to change, correct and
                  improve code exist also. But it is difficult to find
                  programs that work between both domains. In this
                  work, we discuss a scenario based approach to
                  analyze, categorize and remove duplicated code in an
                  object oriented context. The scenario is defined as
                  the relationship between classes containing methods
                  where the duplications were found. A prototype
                  framework, SUPREMO, has been developed to validate
                  our approach. It is characterized by the following
                  aspect: (a) Visualization of the scenario in a
                  graphical global context that gives the developer
                  the possibility to see the impact of the
                  duplication. (b) Visualization of the source code in
                  a textual viewer where a pop-up menu gives the user
                  the opportunity to refactor. Nine case studies
                  (seven written in Smalltalk, one in C++ and one in
                  Java) are analyzed. A presentation of statistical
                  results and a discussion about the qualitative
                  aspect of three applications developed in the SCG
                  group are presented. The qualitative validation is
                  illustrated with a list of examples that simulate
                  the functioning of SUPREMO.},

@incollection{Gond93a,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider describing software
                  development environments (SDEs) using a
                  computational model OOAG (Object Oriented Attribute
                  Grammar), which incorporates functions for managing
                  changes and maintaining consistency. In SDEs, the
                  change management and consistency maintenance are
                  key issues and OOAG is suitable for describing them.
                  Software objects in SDEs have many derived values,
                  and software objects and their derived values have
                  complex relations with each other. Careless human
                  activities often cause inconsistencies among
                  software objects and it usually costs a lot to
                  recover them. OOAG provides declarative descriptions
                  to re-compute automatically derived values based on
                  change propagation and to check relations among
                  software objects, which help recovering activities
                  of programmers. OOAG treats SDEs as aggregated
                  active objects, i.e. tree structures, where software
                  products are distributed. Managing changes of
                  derived values and consistency among software
                  objects are described over tree structures in
                  declarative manner. Attributes associated with nodes
                  are re-computed automatically, if necessary. OOAG is
                  a computational model with the following extensions
                  to standard attribute grammars (AGs): (1) OOAG can
                  change tree structures depending upon their
                  attribute values. (AGs hat have this function are
                  called higher order attribute grammars). (2) OOAG
                  can describe message passing which pastes temporary
                  attributes and their attribution rules to the tree
                  structure. The aim of this paper is to show that our
                  approach of treating SDEs as aggregated objects is
                  natural and OOAG's features are suited for the task
                  of describing change management and consistency
                  control in structure-oriented software development
                  environments.},

	Abstract = {Without a clear understanding of how features of a
                  software system are implemented, a maintenance
                  change in one part of the code may risk adversely
                  affecting other features. Feature implementation and
                  relationships between features are not explicit in
                  the code. To address this problem, we propose an
                  interactive 3D visualization technique based on a
                  combination of static and dynamic analysis which
                  enables the software developer to step through
                  visual representations of execution traces. We
                  visualize dynamic behaviors of execution traces in
                  terms of object creations and interactions and
                  represent this in the context of a static
                  class-hierarchy view of a system. We describe how we

	Abstract = {The analysis of the runtime behavior of a software
                  system yields vast amounts of information, making
                  accurate interpretations difficult. Filtering or
                  compression techniques are often applied to reduce
                  the volume of data without loss of key information
                  vital for a specific analysis goal. Alternatively,
                  visualization is generally accepted as a means of
                  effectively representing large amounts of data. The
                  challenge lies in creating effective and expressive
                  visual representations that not only allows for a
                  global picture, but also enables us to inspect the
                  details of the large data sets. We define the focus
                  of our analysis to be the runtime behavior of
                  features. Static structural visualizations of a
                  system are typically represented in two dimensions.
                  We exploit a third dimension to visually represent
                  the dynamic information, namely object
                  instantiations and message sends. We introduce a
                  novel 3D visualization technique that supports
                  animation of feature behavior and integrates
                  zooming, panning, rotating and on-demand details. As
                  proof of concept, we apply our visualization
                  technique to feature execution traces of an example
                  system.},

	Abstract = {System comprehension is a prerequisite for software
                  maintenance and evolution, but it is a
                  time-consuming and costly activity. In an effort to
                  support system comprehension, researchers have
                  devised many different reverse engineering
                  techniques. Several of these are based on statically
                  analyzing the source code. A purely static
                  perspective, however, overlooks valuable semantic
                  knowledge of a system's problem domain. To address
                  this problem, several researchers have identified
                  thee potential of exploiting features in a reverse
                  engineering context. Features are well-understood
                  abstractions of a problem domain. As such, they
                  represent a valuable resource for reverse
                  engineering a system, as they encapsulate knowledge
                  of a problem domain and denote units of system
                  behavior. The main body of feature-related reverse
                  engineering research is concerned with feature
                  identification, a technique to map features to
                  source code. To fully exploit features in reverse
                  engineering, however, we need to extend the focus
                  beyond feature identification and exploit features
                  as primary units of analysis. We formulate our
                  thesis as follows: To exploit the domain knowledge
                  for object-oriented system comprehension, we need to
                  model features, their relationships to source
                  artefacts, and their relationships to each other.
                  The main contribution of our work is twofold: on the
                  one hand, we enrich reverse engineering analysis of
                  object-oriented systems with semantic knowledge of
                  features, and on the other hand, we introduce new
                  techniques that treat features as the primary
                  entities of analysis A further contribution is our
                  definition of Dynamix, a model for expressing
                  feature entities in the context of a structural
                  model of source code. Using case studies, we
                  demonstrate how our analysis techniques exploit
                  feature knowledge to establish traceability between
                  the problem and solution domains throughout the
                  life-cycle of a system.},

	Abstract = {An effects systems describes how state may be
                  accessed during the execution of some program
                  component. This information is used to assist
                  reasoning about a program, such as determining
                  whether data dependencies may exist between two
                  computations. We define an effects system for {Java}
                  that preserves the abstraction facilities that make
                  object-oriented programming languages attractive.
                  Specifically, a subclass may extend abstract regions
                  of mutable state inherited from the superclass. The
                  effects system also permits an object's state to
                  contain the state of wholly-owned subsidiary
                  objects. In this paper, we describe a set of
                  annotations for declaring permitted effects in
                  method headers, and show how the actual effects in a
                  method body can be checked against the permitted

                  tools have been proposed over the years, assessing
                  their relevance and comparing them is difficult due
                  to the lack of a well-defined, comprehensive, and
                  common framework. In this paper, we introduce such a
                  common comparative framework. The framework builds
                  upon our own experience and extends existing
                  comparative frameworks. We illustrate the
                  comparative framework on two specific design
                  recovery tools.},

                  activity of developers to calculate a "karma" value
                  for each developer. Through the karma value of all
                  its developers a project is ranked on a trustability
                  scale. We present JBender, a proof-of-concept code
                  search engine which implements our trustability
                  metric and we discuss preliminary results from an
                  evaluation of the prototype. Furthermore we discuss
                  findings from the creation of a second prototype --
                  RBender -- that deals with structured search over
                  dynamically typed code.},

                  unit of software under test. To achieve these
                  benefits, unit tests ideally should cover all the
                  possible paths in a program. One unit test usually
                  covers one specific path in one function or method.
                  However a test method is not necessary an
                  encapsulated, independent entity. Often there are
                  implicit dependencies between test methods, hidden
                  in the implementation scenario of a test. In this
                  work we present JExample, an extension to the JUnit
                  testing framework, that supports the declaration of
                  explicit dependencies between test methods. Such
                  dependencies either only define the order in which
                  the test methods are to be executed or they
                  additionally manage the returning of an instance of
                  the test fixture by the provider and passing it to
                  the dependent methods. As JExample extends JUnit,
                  yielding compatible test results, JExample test

                  defects are not well isolated, i.e., one defect

                  several users and different views. To manage this
                  content often a CMS (Content Management System) is
                  used with different levels of access and offer
                  possibilities to edit and change the content. Only a
                  few systems have a security system, which can adapt
                  to changing requirements with another type of
                  security model. Therefore the way access is
                  permitted or denied is fixed in the architecture and
                  the evolution progress of the application. In detail
                  this means that the part of authorization and
                  authentication is often hard-wired into the
                  application and bigger changes to the structure in
                  the application are required to implement for
                  example another policy. Typically the actual
                  implementation of the security system fits the
                  current wishes of the users or developers and is a
                  fixed part of the application and therefore not very
                  easy to exchange nor to adapt a new policy. The
                  proposed pluggable authentication and authorization
                  framework (called JPAAM) offers a solution to this

                  model for their needs and gives developers the
                  possibility to develop an application aside the
                  aspect of authorization and authentication. JPAAM
                  provides highly configurable interfaces with which a

	Abstract = {Traditional IDEs such as Eclipse provide a broad
                  range of supportive tools and views to manage and
                  maintain software projects. However, they provide
                  developers mainly with static views on the source
                  code neglecting any information about runtime
                  behavior. As object-oriented programs heavily rely
                  on polymorphism and late-binding, it is difficult to
                  understand such programs only based on their static
                  structure. Developers therefore tend to gather
                  runtime information with debuggers or profilers to
                  reason about dynamic information. Information
                  gathered using such procedures is volatile and
                  cannot be exploited to support developers navigating
                  the source space to analyze and comprehend the
                  software system or to accomplish other typical
                  software maintenance tasks. In this thesis we
                  present an approach to augment static source
                  perspectives of Eclipse with dynamic information
                  such as precise runtime type information or memory
                  and object allocation statistics. Dynamic
                  information can leverage the understanding for the
                  behavior and structure of a system. We rely on
                  dynamic data gathering based on aspects to analyze
                  running Java systems. To integrate dynamic
                  information into Eclipse we implemented a plugin
                  extending the Eclipse Java Development Toolkit (JDT)
                  called Senseo. This plugin augments existing IDE
                  tools of Eclipse and several standard views of JDT
                  such as the Package Explorer with dynamic
                  information. Besides these enrichments, Senseo
                  provides several visualizations such as an overview
                  of the collaboration within the software system. We
                  comprehensively report on the efficiency of our
                  approach to gather dynamic information. To evaluate
                  our approach we conducted a controlled experiment
                  with 30 professional developers. The results show
                  that the availability of dynamic information in the
                  Eclipse IDE yields for typical software maintenance
                  tasks a significant 17.5\% decrease of time spent
                  while significantly increasing the correctness of
                  the solutions by 33.5\%.},

                  languages have complementary strengths. While static
                  typing provides early error detection, optimized
                  execution and machine-checkable documentation,
                  dynamic typing makes a language more expressive,
                  better suited for rapid prototyping and more
                  adaptive to changing requirements. Pluggable type
                  systems strive to combine these strengths by
                  declaring types and type systems to be optional.
                  Supporting multiple coexisting type systems,
                  pluggable type systems open up a language to various
                  kinds of static analyses other than those provided
                  by traditional type systems. We present TypePlug, a
                  framework for pluggable type systems for Smalltalk.
                  TypePlug provides infrastructure to optionally
                  annotate source code with types and to define in a
                  simple way semantics for type systems. It contains a
                  generic type checking algorithm, dealing with issues
                  arising when statically checking a a dynamically
                  typed language. To improve type checking results and
                  the user experience, TypePlug integrates optional

	Abstract = {Ordinary object type is a one-to-one relation
                  between caller and callee. When communication
                  patters are introduced into object types, they must
                  be extended to relations among to two-or-more
                  object. We propose a new type framework that
                  expresses communication patters and two-or-more
                  object connections, and its implementation on
                  asynchronous faulty networks using future
                  communication property. Although our type is static
                  and not higher order, we can construct a
                  computational model with dynamic properties.},

	Abstract = {We present a mechanism for producing views in an
                  object-oriented system. The results are analogous to
                  database views in traditional database systems,
                  except that our object views hide or expose methods
                  as well as data. The mechanism is based on built-in
                  facilities of our project model for defining data
                  and procedure abstractions and for constructing new
                  types and objects. It uses the type system and the
                  query language of the model to support arbitrary
                  transformations of the underlying representations in
                  designing database views. Careful use of the query
                  language allows one to define updatable views. We
                  also indicate how our abstraction and view mapping
                  capabilities can be used to support federation of
                  heterogeneous software and databases.},

	Abstract = {In der Informatik ist es relativ einfach, sich
                  Informationen zu beschaffen. Es ist ein leichtes an
                  eine Vielzahl von Daten zu gelangen. Dabei ergibt
                  sich die Problematik des Auffindens der
                  gew\"unschten Informationen. Wer hat nicht schon
                  einmal nach Daten gesucht und sie nicht gefunden?
                  Selbstverst\"andlich ist es m\"oglich, Daten so zu
                  benennen und zu ordnen, dass beim n\"achsten Suchen
                  der Aufwand minimal ist. Sucht man aber in fremden

                  einzelne Datei ansehen. Ich habe mich gefragt, ob

@mastersthesis{Held99a,
	Abstract = {Verteilte Applikationen stellen hohe Anforderungen
                  an die Software-Hersteller, da diese Applikationen
                  sehr schnell sehr komplex werden, unzureichende
                  Entwicklungswerkzeuge haben und einen hohen
                  Administrationsaufwand verursachen. Zur
                  Unterst\"utzung werden heutzutage oft Middleware-
                  Technologien eingesetzt, wie zum Beispiel DCOM, RMI
                  oder CORBA. In dieser Arbeit wird CORBA analysiert
                  und mit Hilfe eines in dieser Arbeit erstellten
                  Verbesserungsansatzes und einer Skript-Sprache zu
                  einem Komponenten Framework verbessert. CORBA ist
                  eine Middleware f\"ur verteilte, heterogene
                  Applikationen und verspricht die Unabh\"angigkeit
                  von Programmiersprache sowie eine transparente
                  Verteilung von Objekten. CORBA hat einige
                  Schwachstellen, wie zum Beispiel die mangelhafte
                  Flexibilit\"at, die mit hohem Aufwand verbundene
                  Erweiterbarkeit oder das aufwendige Testen. In der
                  Informationstechnologie gibt es heute viele,
                  schnelle Ver\"anderungen, was ein hohes Mass an
                  Flexibilit\"at und Erweiterbar- beziehungsweise
                  Ver\"anderbarkeit der Software erfordert. In dieser
                  Arbeit wird gezeigt, dass eine Middleware, wie
                  CORBA, durch einen einfachen Verbesserungsansatz,
                  der Komponenten-Proxy-Methode, wesentlich verbessert
                  werden kann. Mit Hilfe dieser Methode und der
                  verwendeten Skript-Sprache Python wird ein
                  Komponenten Framework erstellt, das die Verwendung
                  von verteilten Komponenten wesentlich flexibler
                  macht. Durch dieses Framework wird eine h\"ohere
                  Abstraktion der Applikationen erreicht, da die
                  Applikationslogik von den Komponenten getrennt
                  werden kann und die Komponenten durch Scripting
                  verbunden werden. Dadurch entstehen allgemeinere
                  Komponenten, die einfacher wiederverwendet werden
                  k\"onnen. Die Komponenten-Proxy-Methode f\"ordert
                  zudem die Einsatzm\"oglichkeiten von CORBA. Es
                  werden Ans\"atze f\"ur einen 'travelling agent' und
                  einen 'intelligent proxy' gezeigt.},

	Abstract = {SEDEXfield is a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)
                  program to evaluate the sediment delivery in
                  mountain torrents. The program is written in
                  SuperWaba, an open source programming language which
                  is similar to Java, but specially developed for PDA
                  devices. Using this programming language, it was
                  possible to develop a program running on Palm OS as
                  well as under Windows CE. SEDEX itself is a tool to
                  estimate the sediment delivery of a mountain torrent
                  in case of a flood or a debris flow. It shall help
                  specialists to make their analysis more efficient
                  and to get a more transparent and traceable result
                  which is, for example, used for hazard maps. The
                  tool is developed by the Institute for Geography of
                  the University of Bern in order of the Civil
                  Engineering Office of the canton of Bern. The PDA
                  software was developed at the Institute of Computer
                  Science and Applied Mathematics of the University of
                  Bern as a project in computer science with the
                  Institute for Geography as costumer. This document
                  shall give an overview on the developing process
                  including the project requirements. Furthermore, a
                  technical manual and a user handbook is included
                  into the report.},

@article{Hirs08a,
	Abstract = {Context-dependent behavior is becoming increasingly
                  important for a wide range of application domains,
                  from pervasive computing to common business
                  applications. Unfortunately, mainstream programming
                  languages do not provide mechanisms that enable
                  software entities to adapt their behavior
                  dynamically to the current execution context. This
                  leads developers to adopt convoluted designs to
                  achieve the necessary runtime flexibility. We
                  propose a new programming technique called
                  Context-oriented Programming (COP) which addresses
                  this problem. COP treats context explicitly, and
                  provides mechanisms to dynamically adapt behavior in
                  reaction to changes in context, even after system
                  deployment at runtime. In this paper we lay the
                  foundations of COP, show how dynamic layer
                  activation enables multi-dimensional dispatch,
                  illustrate the application of COP by examples in
                  several language extensions, and demonstrate that
                  COP is largely independent of other commitments to
                  programming style.},

                  due to fear of (4) Type disciplines and object
                  classes are a great help in avoiding these errors.
                  Stronger protection may be obtainable with the help
                  of assertions, particularly invariants, which are
                  intended to be true before and after each call of a
                  method that updates the structure of the heap. This
                  note introduces a mathematical model and language
                  for the formulation of assertions about objects and
                  pointers, and sug- gests that a graphical calculus
                  [Curtis, Lowe] may help in reasoning about program
                  correctness. It deals with both garbage-collected
                  heaps and the other kind. The theory is based on a
                  trace model of graphs, using ideas from process
                  algebra; and our development seeks to exploit this
                  analogy as a unifying principle.},

                  We argue that one reason is that current programming
                  languages and environments assume that components
                  are perfectly coordinated. Yet in a world where
                  programs are mostly composed out of reusable
                  components, these components are not likely to be
                  completely integrated because the sheer number of
                  components would make global coordination
                  impractical. Given that seemingly minor
                  inconsistencies between individually designed
                  components would exist, we examine how they can lead
                  to integration problems with current programming
                  language mechanisms. We discuss several reuse
                  mechanisms that can adapt a component in place
                  without requiring access to the component's source
                  code and without needing to re-typecheck it.},

	Abstract = {In both development and maintenance of software,
                  finding and fixing bugs take a huge percentage of
                  the overall time and resources. Traditional
                  debugging and stepping execution trace are
                  well-accepted techniques to understand deep
                  internals about a program. However in many cases
                  navigating the stack trace is not enough to find
                  bugs, since the cause of a bug is often not in the
                  stack trace anymore and old state is lost, so out of
                  reach from the debugger. Therefore there is a
                  challenge in providing new ways of debugging. In
                  this work, we present the design and implementation
                  of a backward-in-time debugger for a dynamic
                  language, i.e., a debugger that allows one to
                  navigate back the history of the application. We
                  present the design and implementation of a
                  backward-in-time debugger called Unstuck and show
                  our solution to key implementation challenges.},

	Abstract = {Tuple spaces have turned out to be one of the most
                  fundamental abstractions for coordinating software
                  agents. They offer a simple and natural way of
                  communication and are capable to express a large
                  class of distributed and parallel algorithms. While
                  many extensions to the original Linda model have
                  been proposed, no one approach seems to be
                  universally applicable to all problem domains. In
                  this thesis we investigated how a tuple space can be
                  extended to support configurability of its behavior.
                  In this way, several variants of the coordination
                  model can be realized without changing the
                  underlying base system. Moreover, charging tasks to
                  the coordination medium allows a programmer to
                  implement an application at any desired level of
                  abstraction. A prototype framework, OPENSPACES, has
                  been developed with the object-oriented language
                  Smalltalk. It supports both static configurability
                  as well as dynamic reconfiguration of the behavior
                  policies through runtime composition. To be useful
                  in open distributed systems, a coordination medium
                  must be capable of coordinating a variety of
                  different software entities. OPENSPACES therefore is
                  built on top of CORBA and provides access for
                  heterogeneous external clients. It can be used from
                  any platform using any programming language with a
                  CORBA implementation. The sole prerequisite for
                  participating in a OPENSPACES-based application is
                  the implementation of the small IDL interface. Hence
                  not only the provided standard clients, but any
                  external software agent may be coordinated. We
                  present the framework and show with a set of typical
                  examples how it can be instantiated and configured
                  for different and changing needs. As an example of a
                  heterogeneous setup with external clients, a Java
                  agent has been developed to participate in one of
                  the example applications.},

	Abstract = {The statement S<T in a lambda-calculus with
                  subtyping is traditionally interpreted as a semantic
                  coercion function of type [[S]]->[[T]] that extracts
                  the ``T part'' of an element of S. If the subtyping
                  relation is restricted to covariant positions, this
                  interpretation may be enriched to include both the
                  coercion and an overwriting function put[S,T]:
                  [[S]]->[[T]]->[[S]] that updates the T part of an
                  element of S. We give a realizability model and a
                  sound equational theory. Though weaker than familiar
                  calculi of bounded quantification, the restricted
                  system retains sufficient power to model objects,
                  encapsulation, and message passing. Moreover,
                  inheritance may be implemented very
                  straightforwardly in this setting, using the put
                  functions arising from ordinary subtyping of records
                  in place of the more sophisticated systems of record
                  extension and update often used for this purpose.
                  The equational laws relating the behavior of
                  coercions and put functions can be used to prove
                  simple properties of the resulting classes in such a
                  way that proofs for superclasses are ``inherited''

                  constrain their queries by iteratively adding more

	Abstract = {In reverse engineering, class blueprint patterns are
                  an efficient way to determine the purpose and
                  abilities of a class. Finding those patterns is not
                  trivial because the graphical representation of a
                  large software system is too complex to be grasped
                  by a software reengineer or a group of reengineers
                  to find all the similarities and patterns in it.
                  This thesis presents a technique to discover known
                  and unknown class patterns automatically in a
                  software system. Our approach is based on the theory
                  of graph pattern recognition, mainly graph edit
                  distance and maximal common subgraph (MCS)
                  algorithms. Using MCS and hierarchical clustering we
                  automatically detect known and unknown patterns.},

	Abstract = {Relational datasets, i.e., datasets in which
                  individuals are described both by their own features
                  and by their relations to other individuals, arise
                  from various sources such as databases, both
                  relational and object-oriented, knowledge bases, or
                  software models, e.g., UML class diagrams. When
                  processing such complex datasets, it is of prime
                  importance for an analysis tool to hold as much as
                  possible to the initial format so that the semantics
                  is preserved and the interpretation of the final
                  results eased. Therefore, several attempts have been
                  made to introduce relations into the formal concept
                  analysis field which otherwise generated a large
                  number of knowledge discovery methods and tools.
                  However, the proposed approaches invariably look at
                  relations as an intra-concept construct, typically
                  relating two parts of the concept description, and
                  therefore can only lead to the discovery of
                  coarse-grained patterns. As an approach towards the
                  discovery of finer-grain relational concepts, we
                  propose to enhance the classical (object -
                  attribute) data representations with a new dimension
                  that is made out of inter-object links (e.g.,
                  spouse, friend, manager- of, etc.). Consequently,
                  the discovered concepts are linked by relations
                  which, like associations in conceptual data models
                  such as the entity-relation diagrams, abstract from
                  existing links between concept instances. The
                  borders for the application of the relational mining
                  task are provided by what we call a relational
                  context family, a set of binary data tables
                  representing individuals of various sorts (e.g.,
                  human beings, companies, vehicles, etc.) related by
                  additional binary relations. As we impose no
                  restrictions on the relations in the dataset, a
                  major challenge is the processing of relational
                  loops among data items. We present a method for
                  constructing concepts on top of circular
                  descriptions which is based on an iterative
                  approximation of the final solution. The underlying
                  construction methods are illustrated through their
                  application to the restructuring of class
                  hierarchies in object-oriented software engineering,
                  which are described in UML.},

                  Bern vertreibt ein Produkt namens WMLS oder das
                  Multi Language System for Windows. WMLS bietet die
                  M\"oglichkeit ein Programm auf der Microsoft Win32
                  Plattform zu \"ubersetzen, ohne das Programm zu
                  ver\"andern. Dies bedeutet, dass alle auf dem
                  Bildschirm angezeigten Texte in eine andere Sprache
                  als urspr\"unglich vorgesehen. Zudem hat man mit die
                  M\"oglichkeit Texte aus einem Programm auszulesen,
                  um die \"Ubersetzung zu vereinfachen. Um das
                  Gesch\"aftsbereich der \"Ubersetzungssysteme zu
                  erweitern, wollte die TeTrade die M\"oglichkeit
                  eines WMLS \"ahnlichen Systems er\"ortern, welche
                  aber Java Programme \"ubersetzen k\"onnte. Diesem
                  Projekt wurde der Name JMLS, Multi Language System
                  for Java, gegeben. Ziel dieses Projektes war es ein
                  Prototyp f\"ur JMLS zu erstellen, das alle

@inproceedings{Igar99a,
	Abstract = {Virtual types have been proposed as a notation for
                  generic programming in object-oriented
                  languages---an alternative to the more familiar
                  mechanism of parametric classes. The tradeoffs
                  between the two mechanisms are a matter of current
                  debate: for many examples, both appear to offer
                  convenient (indeed almost interchangeable)
                  solutions; in other situations, one or the other
                  seems to be more satisfactory. However, it has
                  proved difficult to draw rigorous comparisons
                  between the two approaches, partly because current
                  proposals for virtual types vary considerably in
                  their details, and partly because the proposals
                  themselves are described rather informally, usually
                  in the complicating context of full-scale language
                  designs. Work on the foundations of object-oriented
                  languages has already established a clear connection
                  between parametric classes and the polymorphic
                  functions found in familiar typed lambda-calculi.
                  Our aim here is to explore a similar connection
                  between virtual types and dependent records. We
                  present, by means of examples, a straightforward
                  model of objects with embedded type fields in a
                  typed lambda-calculus with subtyping, type
                  operators, fixed points, dependent functions, and
                  dependent records with both ``bounded'' and
                  ``manifest'' type fields (this combination of
                  features can be viewed as a measure of the inherent
                  complexity of virtual types). Using this model, we
                  then discuss some of the major differences between
                  previous proposals and show why some can be checked
                  statically while others require run-time checks. We
                  also investigate how the partial ``duality'' of
                  virtual types and parametric classes can be
                  understood in terms of translations between
                  universal and (dependent) existential types.},

                  construction and manipulation. The {\em reflective}
                  model is based on a semantic transformation
                  technique that provides flexible {\em mechanisms}
                  for managing namespaces. We argue that given the
                  ability to manipulate environments directly, one can
                  realize a variety of different object-oriented
                  paradigms within a unified and simple framework.
                  Starting from a kernel language whose foundation is
                  the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus, we develop a
                  small collection of environment manipulating
                  primitives that provide an expressive platform

	Abstract = {Dedicated software search engines that index open
                  source software repositories or in-house software
                  assets significantly enhance the chance of finding
                  software components suitable for reuse. However,
                  they still leave the work of evaluating and testing
                  components to the developer. To significantly change
                  the risk/cost/benefit tradeoff involved in software
                  reuse, search engines need to be supported by user
                  friendly environments that deliver code search
                  functionality, non-intrusively, right to developers'
                  fingertips during key software development
                  activities and significantly raise the quality of
                  search results. In this position paper we describe
                  our attempt to realize this vision through an
                  Eclipse plug-in, Code Conjurer, in tandem with the

@inproceedings{Jeze93a,
	Abstract = {Software environments for commercially available
                  Distributed Memory Parallel Computers (DMPCs) mainly
                  consist of libraries of routines to handle
                  communications between processes written in
                  sequential languages such as C or Fortran. This
                  approach makes it difficult to program massively
                  parallel systems in both an easy and efficient way.
                  Another approach relies on (semi-)automatic
                  parallelizing compilers but it has its own
                  drawbacks. We propose to tackle this problem at an
                  intermediate level (i.e. between high level
                  parallelizing compilers and raw libraries), using
                  Object Oriented (OO) technologies. We show that
                  existing OO techniques based on the reuse of
                  carefully designed software components can be
                  applied with satisfactory results to the large scale
                  scientific computation field. We propose to use a
                  form of parallelism, known as data parallelism, and
                  to embed it in a pure sequential OOL (Eiffel). We
                  illustrate on several examples how sequential
                  components and frameworks can be modified for
                  parallel execution on DM- PCs to allow for
                  transparent parallelisation of classes using these
                  components and frameworks.},

                  applications, we have developed a system called
                  MetaFlex that generates metaclasses to extend the
                  behavior of our C++ classes without inventing
                  variants of the original classes. We make the case
                  that a flexible metaclass generator service that
                  allows developers to freely choose the kind and
                  degree of detail for each metaclass is needed and
                  present our architecture for making this
                  specification. We also illustrate a powerful use of
                  this technique with a scripting extension to our
                  application framework. With an evaluation of our
                  current MetaFlex implementation and its use with the
                  scripting extension, we conclude that this service

	Abstract = {Object-oriented programs evolve by means other than
                  just the addition of new classes. The changes to
                  object-oriented programs that have been most studied
                  are those based on inheritance, on reorganizing a
                  class hierarchy. However, aggregation is a
                  relationship between classes that is just as
                  important as inheritance, and many changes to an
                  object-oriented design involve the
                  aggregate/component relationship. This paper
                  describes some common refactorings based on
                  aggregation, including how to convert from
                  inheritance to an aggregation, and how to reorganize
                  an aggregate/component hierarchy just as one might
                  reorganize a class inheritance hierarchy.},

	Abstract = {The property of a (formal) development method which
                  gives the development process the potential for
                  productivity is compositionality. Interference is
                  what makes it difficult to find compositional
                  development methods for concurrent systems. This
                  paper is intended to contribute to tractable
                  development methods for concurrent programs. In
                  particular it explores ways in which object-based
                  language concepts can be used to provide a
                  compositional development method for concurrent
                  programs. This text summarizes results from three
                  draft papers. It firstly shows how object-based
                  concepts can be used to provide a designer with
                  control over interference and proposes a
                  transformational style of development (for systems
                  with limited interference) in which concurrency is
                  introduced only in the final stages of design. The
                  essential idea here is to show that certain object
                  graphs limit interference. Secondly, the paper shows
                  how a suitable logic can be used to reason about
                  those systems where interference plays an essential
                  role. Here again, concepts are used in the design
                  notation which are taken from object-oriented
                  languages since they offer control of granularity
                  and way of pinpointing interference. Thirdly, the
                  paper outlines the semantics of the design notation
                  mapping its constructs to Milner's $pi$c.},

	Abstract = {Earlier papers give examples of the development of
                  concurrent programs using \pobl\ which is a design
                  notation employing concepts from object-oriented
                  programming languages. Use is made of constraints on
                  the {\em object graphs} to limit interference and
                  assertions over such graphs to reason about about
                  interference. This report merges (and corrects minor
                  inconsistencies between) two papers which document
                  the semantics of \pobl\ by providing a mapping to

                  between components, software structure or developer
                  contribution. The main goal of previous research was
                  mainly to gain a high-level view of an entire
                  system, to ease the task of examination and
                  analysis. Many approaches exist which help detect
                  exceptional entities or to understand how developers
                  work on files. But only little attention has been
                  dedicated to the low-level analysis of software
                  systems. We address this issue with an interactive
                  visualization called Kumpel which consists of a

                  perspective for portfolio management.Our effort is

                  name management and discuss some specific name
                  management concerns arising in object technology for

                  construct name management models and mechanisms.
                  Finally we give an example of how enhanced name
                  management mechanisms might be incorporated into a

                  zahlreich sind die vorgeschlagenen Techniken,
                  Werkzeuge und Methoden zur Lsung dieser Probleme.
                  Trotzdem scheitern zahlreiche Softwareprojekte. In
                  dieser Arbeit wird nicht eine weitere Methode oder
                  Technik zur Softwareentwicklung definiert. Vielmehr
                  habe ich meine Erfahrungen in einer einfachen Liste
                  von Grunds{\"a}tzen zusammengefasst. Theorie und

	Abstract = {Object-oriented language are a powerful tool for
                  making a system end-programmer specializable. But,
                  in cases where the system not only accepts objects
                  as input, but also creates objects internally,
                  specialization has been more difficult. This has
                  been referred to as the ``make isn't generic
                  problem.'' We present a new object-oriented language
                  concept, called traces, that we have used
                  successfully to support specialization in cases that
                  were previously cumbersome. The concept of traces
                  makes a fundamental separation between two kinds of
                  inheritance in object-oriented languages:
                  inheritance of specialization --- an aspect of code
                  sharing; and inheritance of specialization, a
                  sometimes static, sometimes dynamic phenomena.},

                  emerging trends in academic tool building were
                  evident. First, tools are increasingly constructed
                  on the basis of external code, reusing, for
                  instance, existing frameworks and integrated
                  development environments. Second, researchers often
                  choose dynamic languages such as Smalltalk to
                  implement prototype tools. Third, Web-based tools
                  are starting to incorporate Web 2.0 technologies to
                  improve user interaction. Finally, increasing
                  computational resources allow tools to tackle
                  larger, real-world code bases.},

	Abstract = {Software repositories have been getting a lot of
                  attention from researchers in recent years. In order
                  to analyze software repositories, it is necessary to
                  first extract raw data from the version control and
                  problem tracking systems. This poses two challenges:
                  (1) extraction requires a non-trivial effort, and
                  (2) the results depend on the heuristics used during
                  extraction. These challenges burden researchers that
                  are new to the community and make it difficult to
                  benchmark software repository mining since it is
                  almost impossible to reproduce experiments done by
                  another team. In this paper we present the TA-RE
                  corpus. TA-RE collects extracted data from software
                  repositories in order to build a collection of
                  projects that will simplify extraction process.
                  Additionally the collection can be used for
                  benchmarking. As the first step we propose an
                  exchange language capable of making sharing and
                  reusing data as simple as possible.},

@mastersthesis{Kneu03a,
	Abstract = {In component-based software development, a software
                  application is composed of components that are
                  plugged together. While components represent the
                  stable parts, the changing or evolving configuration
                  of a system is defined in scripts. The separation of
                  changing from stable parts promises flexible
                  software systems. Compositional styles that define
                  component interfaces, higher-level connectors and
                  composition rules describe an architectural
                  framework. Styles expose the large-scale
                  architecture of a software system explicitly in
                  scripts. But they lack a formal foundation allowing
                  one to reason about styles. We propose to use
                  Contractual types, an experimental type system that
                  can express both services provided and required by a
                  component, as a formal basis to define compositional
                  styles. We argue that this approach permits us (1)
                  to verify the consistency of a style, (2) to check
                  the implementation of a style for correctness, and
                  (3) to detect compositional mismatches in component
                  configurations. We exemplify our claims by giving
                  type-based definitions of some compositional styles.
                  Implementing a contractual type checker for the
                  composition language Piccola allows us to verify
                  existing style implementations in Piccola against
                  the definitions given. A flexible implementation of
                  the Piccola language in {Java} provides a basis for
                  the experiments with the type system.},

	Abstract = {The aim of component technology is the replacement
                  of large monolithic applications with sets of
                  smaller software components, whose particular
                  functionality and interoperation can be adapted to
                  users' needs. However, the adaptation mechanisms of
                  component software are still limited. Most proposals
                  concentrate on adaptations that can be achieved
                  either at compile time or at link time. Current
                  support for dynamic component adaptation, i.e.
                  unanticipated, incremental modifications of a
                  component system at run-time, is not sufficient.
                  This paper proposes object-based inheritance (also
                  known as delegation) as a complement to purely
                  forwarding-based object composition. It presents a
                  type-safe integration of delegation into a
                  class-based object model and shows how it overcomes
                  the problems faced by for\-warding-based component
                  interaction, how it supports independent
                  extensibility of components and unanticipated,
                  dynamic component adaptation.},

@mastersthesis{Kobe05a,
	Abstract = {We live in a world where we are surrounded with
                  information technology. The software systems around
                  us are countless. All of those systems have been
                  written once and must be maintained today. While a
                  system evolves it becomes difficult to maintain. We
                  use reengineering tools today to simplify
                  maintenance tasks. With the support of such tools we
                  can change the form of software systems in a way
                  that makes them easier to analyze. Before we can use
                  any reengineering tool with a software system we
                  must reverse engineer that system. To reverse
                  engineer a software system means that we need to
                  build a model from the system. This model represents
                  our system in a more abstract way than the source
                  code itself does. The way from the source code to
                  the model is often a problem. If a reengineering
                  tool supports a specific model the maintainers of
                  that tool must provide a parser for every
                  programming language they want to support. Such
                  parsers translate source code written in a
                  particular language into a model. There are so many
                  languages used in systems today that it is not
                  possible to support all of them. Additionally, the
                  languages themselves evolve and so we need parsers
                  for every version and every dialect of a programming
                  language. There are a number of approaches to solve
                  that problem (for example fuzzy parsing). Most of
                  these approaches are not flexible enough for today's
                  needs: We cannot adapt them to another programming
                  language or if we can we need a lot of knowledge
                  about the language and about the whole parsing
                  technique. Depending on the technique that we use we
                  must write a parser or at least a grammar as a basis
                  for a parser generator. In most of the cases this is
                  a difficult and time-consuming task. Our idea is to
                  build an application that generates parsers based on
                  mapping examples. A mapping example is a section in
                  the source code to which we assign an element in our
                  target model. Based on these examples, our
                  application builds grammars and generates a parser.
                  If the parser fails to parse some code our
                  application asks the user to provide more examples.
                  This approach is flexible enough to work with a
                  software system written in an arbitrary programming
                  language. The user does not need to have knowledge
                  about parsing. However, he should be able to
                  recognize the elements in the source code that he
                  wants to map on the elements in the target model. We
                  prove the flexibility of that approach with our
                  reference implementation called CodeSnooper. This
                  application works with any input. As target model we
                  take the FAMIX model that is used by the MOOSE
                  reengineering environment.},

	Abstract = {Two of the most important problems that open
                  distributed systems face in large heterogeneous
                  networks are the scalability of the underlying
                  mechanisms and the interoperation of the different
                  applications. In this thesis we introduce the Cell,
                  a framework for the design of a scalable Strongly
                  Distributed Object Based System that supports a high
                  level of interoperation between the different
                  applications. The basic element in the Cell
                  framework is a cell which is composed of membrane
                  and a nucleus. The membrane encapsulates the nucleus
                  and provides support for all communication with the
                  external world while the nucleus manages all local

	Abstract = {One of the important advantages of the
                  object-oriented design and development methodology
                  is the ability to reuse existing software modules.
                  However the introduction of many programming
                  languages with different syntax, semantics and/or
                  paradigms has created the need for a consistent
                  interlanguage interoperability support framework. We
                  present a brief overview of the most characteristic
                  interoperability support methods and frameworks
                  allowing the access and reuse of objects from
                  different programming environments and focus on the
                  interface bridging object-oriented interoperability
                  support approach.},

@incollection{Kris93a,
	Abstract = {A \fItransverse activity\fR is an activity executed
                  by several objects in some combination. The activity
                  is described as a single unit, separately from the
                  descriptions of the participating objects. A
                  transverse activity is described and executed by
                  using the usual object-centric actions, i.e. the
                  methods of the objects, and is seen as a natural
                  supplement to the description of the cooperation of
                  active objects. Transverse activities support the
                  modeling of our conceptual understanding of combined
                  activities. Our conceptual understanding not only
                  includes the recognition of usual components but
                  also the recognition of activities combined from the
                  individual actions of such components. We are used
                  to recognize components as phenomena, but transverse
                  activities are phenomena also and these activities
                  may be classified, specialized, and aggregated, i.e.
                  abstraction in this sense is possible also for such
                  activities. The description of a transverse activity
                  must at least include a listing of the components
                  participating in the activity and a listing of the
                  sequence of actions making up the combined directive
                  of the activity. In the specialization or
                  aggregation of activities by means of other
                  activities both the participants and the directive
                  can be included in these forms of abstraction to
                  support the underlying intention of transverse
                  activities. Usual language mechanisms such as class,
                  object etc. in various forms are used to model
                  phenomena and concepts. A ongoing revision and
                  extension of such usual object-oriented language
                  mechanisms is necessary to be able to model,
                  directly and naturally, additional differentiating
                  elements of conceptual understanding, such as e.g.
                  transverse activities. Transverse activities are
                  illustrated and motivated by means of several minor
                  fragments of a complex example and an conceptual
                  understanding of transverse activities is outlined.
                  Language mechanisms supporting the classification,
                  specialization, and aggregation of transverse
                  activities is defined by means of special
                  activity-classes and -objects. Various possibilities
                  for adding new and powerful features as part of such
                  mechanisms are discussed. The meaning of the
                  execution of activity-objects in relation to the
                  execution of the components involved in the activity
                  is defined in terms of interleaved execution.},

@mastersthesis{Kueh98a,
	Abstract = {To keep up with rapidly changing requirements
                  applications are increasingly built out of software
                  components. A new trend is now to give those
                  software components control over their own actions,
                  to turn them into concurrently running software
                  agents. These software agents have to be relatively
                  independent to keep them exchangeable. Although
                  independent, they still need to interact in order to
                  achieve the application's overall goal. This results
                  in the need to coordinate their interactions. A
                  number of coordination models were created to
                  express common coordination solutions. Linda is one
                  of the most prominent representatives of such
                  coordination models. Linda is widely used because it
                  offers simple means to separate coordination code
                  from computational code within a single agent. Linda
                  also offers a high degree of decoupling of agents
                  through its generative communication style. However,
                  Linda offers no direct support for the concentration
                  of the coordination aspects of a whole application
                  in a single location. Furthermore, Linda only offers
                  a set of primitive operations and leaves the user
                  with the task to construct realistic coordination
                  abstractions out of them. Coordination abstractions
                  are often hard-coded into the participant agents'
                  protocols and therefore neither flexible nor
                  reusable. They are typically spread all over the
                  application and it is almost impossible to identify
                  them. It is not easy to encapsulate coordination
                  abstractions because coordination typically affects
                  multiple agents, and in open systems other
                  requirements, such as flexibility and security, must
                  also be dealt with. We propose an open, flexible and
                  extensible architecture for explicit coordination
                  abstractions in open systems, called APROCO. Our
                  solution is based on the insight that separation of
                  concerns (coordination and computation) is a
                  necessary precondition for building reusable parts.
                  The client agents of APROCO communicate through
                  shared data spaces known from Linda using its
                  generative communication style. The coordination
                  between the participating agents is managed through
                  special coordination agents that implement the used
                  coordination abstractions. We present a list of
                  coordination abstractions in open systems and show
                  the applicability of the approach with some
                  examples.},

                  external iterators, it is commonly assumed that they
                  are not applicable in languages without builtin
                  support for closures and that they are less flexible
                  than external iterators. We present an iteration
                  framework that uses objects to emulate closures,
                  separates structure exploration and data
                  consumption, and generalizes on folding, thereby
                  invalidating both the above statements. Our proposed
                  "transfold" scheme allows processing one or more
                  data structures simultaneously without exposing
                  structure representations and without writing
                  explicit loops. We show that the use of two
                  functional concepts (function parameterization and
                  lazy evaluation) within an object-oriented language
                  allows combining the safety and economic usage of
                  internal iteration with the flexibility and client
                  control of external iteration. Sample code is
                  provided using the statically typed Eiffel

	Abstract = {Many approaches have been developed to comprehend
                  software source code, most of them focusing on
                  program structural information. However, in doing so
                  we are missing a crucial information, namely, the
                  domain semantics information contained in the text
                  or symbols of the source code. When we are to
                  understand software as a whole, we need to enrich
                  these approaches with conceptual insights gained
                  from the domain semantics. This paper proposes the
                  use of information retrieval techniques to exploit
                  linguistic information, such as identifier names and
                  comments in source code, to gain insights into how
                  the domain is mapped to the code. We introduce
                  Semantic Clustering, an algorithm to group source
                  artifacts based on how they use similar terms. The
                  algorithm uses Latent Semantic Indexing. After
                  detecting the clusters, we provide an automatic
                  labeling and then we visually explore how the
                  clusters are spread over the system. Our approach
                  works at the source code textual level which makes
                  it language independent. Nevertheless, we correlate
                  the semantics with structural information and we
                  apply it at different levels of abstraction (for
                  example packages, classes, methods). To validate our
                  approach we applied it on several case studies.},

                  and operations related to a group of objects rather
                  than to a single object only. For example, given a
                  person object with an income property, the average
                  income applies to a group of persons as a whole

                  However, collective behavior is modeled as part of

                  overview of a complex software system.
                  Unfortunately, since software has no physical shape,
                  there is no ``natural'' mapping of software to a
                  two-dimensional space. As a consequence most
                  visualizations tend to use a layout in which
                  position and distance have no meaning, and
                  consequently layout typical diverges from one
                  visualization to another. We propose a consistent
                  layout for software maps in which the position of a
                  software artifact reflects its \emph{vocabulary},
                  and distance corresponds to similarity of
                  vocabulary. We use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to
                  map software artifacts to a vector space, and then
                  use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to map this
                  vector space down to two dimensions. The resulting
                  consistent layout allows us to develop a variety of
                  thematic software maps that express very different
                  aspects of software while making it easy to compare

	Abstract = {SUITE is a new workshop series that specifically
                  focuses on exploring the notion of search as a
                  fundamental activity during software development.
                  The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers and
                  practitioners with special interest on search
                  technology for software developers together.
                  Participants will have broad range of expertise in
                  topics ranging from building software tools and
                  infrastructure, Information Retrieval, user studies
                  and Human-computer interaction, benchmarking and
                  evaluation. The first edition of SUITE is held in
                  conjunction with the 31st International Conference
                  in Software Engineering (May 16th, 2009. Vancouver,

	Abstract = {Search-driven development is mainly concerned with
                  code reuse but also with code navigation and
                  debugging. In this essay we look at search-driven
                  navigation in the IDE. We consider Smalltalk-80 as
                  an example of a programming system with
                  search-driven navigation capabilities and explore
                  its human factors. We present how immediate search
                  results lead to a user experience of code browsing
                  rather than one of waiting for and clicking through
                  search results. We explore the socio-technical
                  congruence of immediate search, ie unification of
                  tasks and breakpoints with method calls, which leads
                  to simpler and more extensible development tools.
                  Eventually we conclude with remarks on the
                  socio-technical congruence of search-driven
                  development.},

@article{Kuhn10b,
	Abstract = {Software visualizations can provide a concise overview of a complex software
          system. Unfortunately, as software has no physical shape, there is no `natural' mapping
          of software to a two-dimensional space. As a consequence most visualizations tend to
          use a layout in which position and distance have no meaning, and consequently layout
          typically diverges from one visualization to another. We propose an approach to
          consistent layout for software visualization, called Software Cartography, in which the
          position of a software artifact reflects its vocabulary, and distance corresponds to
          similarity of vocabulary. We use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to map software
          artifacts to a vector space, and then use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to map this
          vector space down to two dimensions. The resulting consistent layout allows us to
          develop a variety of thematic software maps that express very different aspects of
          software while making it easy to compare them. The approach is especially suitable for
          comparing views of evolving software, as the vocabulary of software artifacts tends to
          be stable over time. We present a prototype implementation of Software Cartography, and
          illustrate its use with practical examples from numerous open-source case studies.},

                  Mit diesen Karten kann man an einem Tag soweit

	Abstract = {Stevens, Myers, and Constantine introduced the
                  notion of cohesion, an ordinal scale of seven levels
                  that describes the degree to which the actions
                  performed by a module contribute to a unified
                  function [12]. They provided rules, termed as
                  `associative principles' to examine the
                  relationships between `processing elements' of a
                  module and designate a cohesion level to it. Stevens
                  et. al., however, did not give a precise definition
                  for the term `processing element', thereby leaving
                  it open for interpretations.This paper interprets
                  the `output variables' (not statements) of a module
                  as its processing elements. Stevens et. al.'s
                  associative principles are transformed to relate the
                  output variables based on their `data' and `control
                  dependence' relationships. What results is a
                  rule-based approach to computing cohesion.
                  Experimental results show that, but for temporal
                  cohesion, the cohesion associated to a module under
                  our reinterpretation and that due to the original
                  Definitions are identical for all examples.},

                  engineering tools are a great help in this process
                  of required adaption. In order for these tools to be
                  flexible, they work with models, abstract
                  representations of the source code. The extraction
                  of such information from source code can be done
                  using a parser. However, it is fairly tedious to
                  build new parsers. And this is made worse by the
                  fact that it has to be done over and over again for
                  every language we want to analyze. In this paper we
                  propose a novel approach which minimizes the
                  knowledge required of a certain language for the
                  extraction of models implemented in that language by
                  reflecting on the implementation of preparsed ASTs
                  provided by an IDE. In a second phase we use a
                  technique referred to as Model Mapping by Example to
                  map platform dependent models onto domain specific
                  model.},

	Abstract = {Reverse engineering tools are a great help in the
                  process of adapting an existing software system to
                  novel contexts. Current implementations use models
                  of software systems to keep themselves language
                  independent. This also implies that the models have
                  to be built before a software system can be analyzed
                  by such a tool. A common approach is to build
                  language specific parsers to extract the information
                  from the source-code. But: Manually building parsers
                  is tedious work. This calls for a new approach. In
                  our approach we rely on the fact that there are
                  already pre-parsed ASTs of software systems. Such
                  parsing applications can be found in applications
                  which host software systems of several languages.
                  These ASTs are needed by the host application to
                  provide auto-completion or syntax highlighting for
                  example. In order to minimize the required knowledge
                  about a certain language when extracting models we
                  recycle those ASTs. We hook into a specific host
                  application, Eclipse, and the ASTs generated by such
                  parsing applications, namely language plugins. Such
                  a language plugin is responsible for building the
                  AST from a software system written in that language
                  and thus provides support for that language to
                  Eclipse. The basic idea relies on extracting the
                  information of such an AST to build a model which
                  can be used by reverse engineering applications.},

                  visualization and software metrics which we have
                  already successfully applied in the field of
                  software reverse engineering. Using this approach we
                  discuss a simple and effective way to visualize the
                  evolution of software systems which helps to recover
                  the evolution of object oriented software systems.},

	Abstract = {Software visualization tools face many challenges in
                  terms of their implementation, including
                  scalability, usability, adaptability, and
                  durability. Such tools, like many other research
                  tools, tend to have a short life cycle and are
                  vulnerble to software evolution processes because of
                  the complex problem domain and the constantly
                  changing requirements which are dictated by research
                  goals. In this paper we discuss the implementation
                  of the software visualization tool CodeCrawler
                  according to five criteria, namely the overall
                  architecture, the internal architecture, the
                  visualization engine, the metamodel and the
                  interactive facilities. This discussion generates
                  implementation recommendations and design guidelines
                  that hold for our tool and the class of tools its
                  stands for. We then also extract common design
                  guidelines and recommendations that apply for other
                  software visualization and general reverse
                  engineering tools as well, and hope that these
                  insights can be used fruitfully by other researchers
                  in this field.},

@phdthesis{Lanz03b,
	Abstract = {The maintenance, reengineering, and evolution of
                  object-oriented software systems has become a vital
                  matter in today's software industry. Although most
                  systems start off in a clean and well-designed
                  state, with time they tend to gradually decay in
                  quality, unless the systems are reengineered and
                  adapted to the evolving requirements. However,
                  before such legacy software systems can be
                  reengineered and evolved, they must be reverse
                  engineered, i.e., their structure and inner working
                  must b e understood. This is difficult because of
                  several factors, such as the sheer size of the
                  systems, their complexity, their domain specificity,
                  and in general the bad state legacy software systems
                  are in. In this thesis we propose a visual approach
                  to the reverse engineering of object-oriented
                  software systems by means of polymetric views,
                  lightweight visualizations of software enriched with
                  metrics and other types of semantic information
                  about the software, e.g., its age, version,
                  abstractness, location, structure, function, etc. We
                  present and discuss several polymetric views which
                  allow us to understand three different aspects of
                  object-oriented software, namely (1) coarse-grained
                  aspects which allow for the understanding of very
                  large systems, (2) fine -grained aspects which allow
                  for the understanding of classes and class
                  hierarchies, and (3) evolutionary aspects, which
                  enable us to recover and understand the evolution of
                  a software system. The combination of these three
                  types of information can greatly reduce the time
                  needed to gain an understanding of an
                  object-oriented software system. Based on the
                  application of our polymetric views, we present our
                  reverse engineering methodology which we validated
                  and refined on several occasions in industrial set
                  tings. It allows us to explore and combine these
                  three approaches into one single visual approach to
                  understand software.},

                  publications and advances in this research field,
                  still not being considered by mainstream software
                  industry: currently very few integrated development
                  environments offer (if at all) only limited
                  visualization support, and in general it can be said
                  that software visualization is being ignored at a

	Abstract = {A software system may become very large during its
                  evolution, getting less maintain-able while its
                  complexity rises. Since replacing the system with a
                  new one is often out of question because of economic
                  considerations, reengineering techniques are being
                  developed to change the system into a form which
                  makes it easier to maintain and to further develop.
                  However, before a system can be reengineered, it has
                  to be reverse engineered in order to understand its
                  nature and inner logic. This work deals with a
                  lightweight approach to software reverse engineering
                  com-bining simple graphs with simple object oriented
                  metrics. Our goal is to obtain a simple and scalable
                  graphical display of a system and its parts through
                  which we succeed to visually extract information,
                  which is useful to the understanding of the system
                  and the detection of its design problems. The
                  primary goal of this work is to put up a repository
                  of combinations of graphs and metrics which are
                  useful to reverse engineer an object oriented
                  system. To validate our approach we implemented a
                  tool called CodeCrawler, which can graphically
                  dis-play source code while providing a layer of
                  interactivity to the user: we use the term
                  navigating the code. We ran CodeCrawler on two
                  Smalltalk case studies and one large industrial case
                  study written in C++. The positive experiences and
                  reactions which we obtained are a proof of the
                  usefulness of our idea.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the Object-Oriented
                  Specification Language, a language based on Formal
                  Description Technique (FDT) in the style of Vienna
                  Development Method (VDM) so called OOVDM,
                  additionally includes its denotational semantics and
                  implementation. Our research contributes to the
                  extension of VDM by an Object-Oriented concept which
                  supports incremental and subtyping inheritance.
                  OOVDM has two types of modules, which are class
                  modules and type modules. Class modules define
                  objects having their internal states. Their states
                  can be changed states, i.e. values, and denote the
                  domains of the values. OOVDM has two kinds of
                  inheritance mechanisms---incremental inheritance and
                  subtyping inheritance. Both concepts are useful for
                  overloading existing descriptions and for
                  hierarchical classification of the objects.},

                  tools supporting various methods are stand-alone and
                  are not agreed on a common standard. This results in
                  the issues of tool integration in software
                  engineering environments. Our main aim in this paper
                  is to illustrate the integration of the analysis
                  tool named Analyst WorkBench(AWB) supporting the O*
                  object-oriented method in the PCTE Emeraude-based
                  software engineering environment. The integration is
                  achieved through data sharing and the reuse of
                  types. The O* method and the AWB have been developed
                  within the framework of the ESPRIT II project named
                  Business Class.},

                  relationship to the environment in which they are
                  executed, the paper identifies the sources of
                  evolutionary pressure on computer applications and
                  programs and shows why this results in a process of
                  never ending maintenance activity. The resultant
                  life cycle processes are then briefly discussed. The
                  paper then introduces laws of Program Evolution that
                  have been formulated following quantitative studies
                  of the evolution of a number of different systems.
                  Finally an example is provided of the application of
                  Evolution Dynamics models to program release

@inproceedings{Lenc99a,
	Abstract = {Program errors are hard to find because of the
                  cause-effect gap between the time when an error
                  occurs and the time when the error becomes apparent
                  to the programmer. Although debugging techniques
                  such as condi tional and data breakpoints help to
                  find error causes in simple cases, they fail to
                  effectively bridge the cause-effect gap in many
                  situations. Dynamic query- based debuggers offer
                  programmers an effective tool that provides instant
                  error alert by continuously checking inter-object
                  relationships while the debugged program is running.
                  To speed up dynamic query evaluation, our debugger
                  (implemented in portable {Java}) uses a combination
                  of program instrumentation, load-time code
                  generation, query optimization, and incre mental
                  reevaluation. Experiments and a query cost model
                  show that selection queries are efficient in most
                  cases, while more costly join queries are practical
                  when query evaluations are infrequent or query
                  domains are small.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive software is a new kind of generic software
                  which attempts to minimize and localize dependency
                  on the context in which the software will be used.
                  An Adaptive program is written in terms of
                  constraints on the customizing context in which the
                  program may be used. The constraints are written so
                  that the only encode necessary dependencies and at
                  the same time they localize information on groups of
                  collaborating classes. Adaptive software is usually
                  written for a given context in mind and therefore it
                  is important that the adaptive program does not use
                  too much information from the current context.
                  Therefore, we introduce in this paper a dependency
                  metric which measures context dependency between an
                  adaptive program and a customizer. The paper also
                  discusses how constraints on customizing contexts
                  can be written so that information loss is
                  eliminated.},

	Abstract = {Web-applications are very popular, lightweight
                  applications that entirely run in web-browsers over

	Abstract = {This thesis discusses the implementation of traits.
                  The result it presents is a new Smalltalk kernel
                  bootstrapped with traits. The implementation is
                  fully done in Squeak, an open-source dialect of
                  Smalltalk. It is planned that the next generation of
                  Squeak will include traits. Because traits are
                  simple and completely backward compatible with
                  single inheritance, implementing traits in a
                  reflective single inheritance language like Squeak
                  is unproblematic. However, an implementation with a
                  sophisticated and clean design, with the robustness
                  to be used in production and the flexibility to be
                  used as a vehicle for future research, is not
                  trivial. Furthermore our work is aimed at serving as
                  a reference implementation for the introduction of
                  traits in other languages. Hence, we focused on
                  building a simple but powerful system for the
                  future. Consequently following the fundamental idea
                  of a reflective language --- using the features of
                  the language to define the behavior of the language
                  itself --- we bootstrapped the new kernel which,
                  eventually, allowed us to fully express the system
                  itself with traits. The refactoring of the core of
                  the Smalltalk language as a composition of traits
                  not only improved its quality but also enhanced its
                  understandability. This has the advantage that it is
                  easier maintainable and it facilitates
                  experimentation with the language because the
                  different aspects of the kernel are now available as
                  traits and can therefore be recomposed to create new
                  kernel classes with different properties.},

	Abstract = {The domain-specific ontology of a software system
                  includes a set of features and their relationships.
                  While the problem of locating features in
                  object-oriented programs has been widely studied,
                  runtime dependencies between features are less well
                  understood. Features cannot be understood in
                  isolation, since their behavior often depends on
                  objects created and referenced in previously
                  exercised features. It is difficult to spot runtime
                  dependencies between features just by browsing
                  source code. Hence, code modifications intended for
                  one feature, often inadvertently affect other
                  features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
                  precisely identify dependencies between features
                  based on a fine-grained dynamic analysis which
                  captures details about how objects are referenced at
                  runtime. The results of two case studies indicate
                  that our approach helps software maintainers in
                  understanding critical feature dependencies.},

                  Researching the tool's design is part of the

	Abstract = {We need to understand the impact of side effects
                  whenever changing complex object-oriented software
                  systems. This can be difficult as side effects are
                  at best implicit in static views of the software,
                  and typically execution traces do not capture data
                  flow between parts of the system. To solve this
                  problem, we complement execution traces with dynamic
                  object flow information. In our previous work we
                  analyzed object flows between features and classes.
                  In this paper, we use object flow information to
                  analyze side effects in execution traces and to
                  detect how future behavior in the trace is affected
                  by it. Using a visualization, the developer can
                  study how a selected part of the program accessed
                  program state and what side effect its execution
                  produced. Like this, the developer can investigate
                  how a particular part of the program works without
                  needing to understand the source code in detail. To
                  illustrate our approach, we use a running example of
                  writing unit tests for a legacy system.},

	Abstract = {Writing unit tests for legacy systems is a key
                  maintenance task. When writing tests for
                  object-oriented programs, objects need to be set up
                  and the expected effects of executing the unit under
                  test need to be verified. If developers lack
                  internal knowledge of a system, the task of writing
                  tests is non-trivial. To address this problem, we
                  propose an approach that exposes side effects
                  detected in example runs of the system and uses
                  these side effects to guide the developer when
                  writing tests. We introduce a visualization called
                  Test Blueprint, through which we identify what the
                  required fixture is and what assertions are needed
                  to verify the correct behavior of a unit under test.
                  The dynamic analysis technique that underlies our
                  approach is based on both tracing method executions
                  and on tracking the flow of objects at runtime. To
                  demonstrate the usefulness of our approach we
                  present results from two case studies.},

	Abstract = {Back-in-time debuggers are extremely useful tools
                  for identifying the causes of bugs, as they allow us
                  to inspect the past states of objects no longer
                  present in the current execution stack.
                  Unfortunately the "omniscient" approaches that try
                  to remember all previous states are impractical
                  because they either consume too much space or they
                  are far too slow. Several approaches rely on
                  heuristics to limit these penalties, but they
                  ultimately end up throwing out too much relevant
                  information. In this paper we propose a practical
                  approach to back-in-time debugging that attempts to
                  keep track of only the relevant past data. In
                  contrast to other approaches, we keep object history
                  information together with the regular objects in the
                  application memory. Although seemingly
                  counter-intuitive, this approach has the effect that
                  past data that is not reachable from current
                  application objects (and hence, no longer relevant)
                  is automatically garbage collected. In this paper we
                  describe the technical details of our approach, and
                  we present benchmarks that demonstrate that memory
                  consumption stays within practical bounds.
                  Furthermore since our approach works at the virtual
                  machine level, the performance penalty is
                  significantly better than with other approaches.},

	Abstract = {The behavior of an object-oriented software system
                  is notoriously hard to understand from the source
                  code alone. The main reason is the large gap between
                  the program's static structure and its actual
                  runtime behavior. Features inherent to
                  object-orientation, like object aliasing and late
                  binding, - while providing a high degree of
                  expressiveness to model an application domain - make
                  programs hard to understand, maintain, and analyze.
                  Complementary to static analysis, dynamic analysis
                  can help to close this gap by investigating the
                  properties of a running program. The state of the
                  art in dynamic analysis focuses on investigating
                  runtime control flow and structures of object
                  graphs, but a thorough analysis of how objects are
                  passed through a system is missing. Tracking how
                  object references are transferred, however, is
                  essential to analyze the dependencies introduced by
                  object aliasing. In this dissertation we propose
                  Object Flow Analysis, our approach to track object
                  flow by explicitly representing object references
                  and reference transfer. Object Flow Analysis
                  provides an effective and original way of analyzing
                  and runtime monitoring dependencies introduced by
                  object aliasing. To validate Object Flow Analysis,
                  we propose three different reverse engineering
                  applications that, based on Object Flow Analysis,
                  reason about aliasing dependencies in
                  object-oriented programs. Yet Object Flow Analysis
                  extends beyond traditional reverse engineering
                  applications. A key contribution of our work is that
                  we advance the state of the art in back-in-time
                  debugging by proposing and providing an
                  implementation of the concept of Object Flow
                  Analysis in a high-level language virtual machine.},

	Abstract = {Conventional debugging tools present developers with
                  means to explore the run-time context in which an
                  error has occurred. In many cases this is enough to
                  help the developer discover the faulty source code
                  and correct it. However, rather often errors occur
                  due to code that has executed in the past, leaving
                  certain objects in an inconsistent state. The actual
                  run-time error only occurs when these inconsistent
                  objects are used later in the program. So-called
                  back-in-time debuggers help developers step back
                  through earlier states of the program and explore
                  execution contexts not available to conventional
                  debuggers. Nevertheless, even back-in-time debuggers
                  do not help answer the question, ``Where did this
                  object come from?'' The Object-Flow Virtual Machine,
                  which we have proposed in previous work, tracks the
                  flow of objects to answer precisely such questions,
                  but this VM does not provide dedicated debugging
                  support to explore faulty programs. In this paper we
                  present a novel debugger, called Compass, to
                  navigate between conventional run-time
                  stack-oriented control flow views and object flows.
                  Compass enables a developer to effectively navigate
                  from an object contributing to an error back-in-time
                  through all the code that has touched the object. We
                  present the design and implementation of Compass,
                  and we demonstrate how flow-centric, back-in-time
                  debugging can be used to effectively locate the
                  source of hard-to-find bugs.},

	Abstract = {The use of hierarchy is an important component of
                  object-oriented design. Hierarchy allows the use of
                  type families, in which higher level supertypes
                  capture the behavior that all of their subtypes have
                  in common. For this methodology to be effective, it
                  is necessary to have a clear understanding of how
                  subtypes and supertypes are related. This paper
                  presents a new definition of the subtype relation
                  that ensures that any property proved about
                  supertype objects also holds for subtype objects. It
                  also discusses the ramifications of the definition
                  on the design of type families. (superseded by

	Abstract = {THOR is a persistent object store that provides a
                  powerful programming model. THOR ensures that
                  persistent objects are accessed only by calling
                  their methods and it supports atomic transactions.
                  The result is a system that allows applications to
                  share objects safely across both space and time. The
                  paper describes how the THOR implementation is able
                  to support this pow-erful model and yet achieve good
                  performance, even in a wide-area, large-scale
                  distributed environment. It describes the techniques
                  used in THOR to meet the challenge of providing good
                  performance in spite of the need to manage very
                  large numbers of very small objects. In addition,
                  the paper puts the performance of THOR in
                  perspective by showing that it substantially
                  outperforms a system based on memory mapped files,
                  even though that system provides much less
                  functionality than THOR.},

	Abstract = {We present an object-centered approach for
                  manipulating hierarchically complex objects, which
                  covers an extended object model and an
                  object-centered query algebra. Extensions of the
                  object model are mainly based on a separation of
                  structural and semantic elements in modeling complex
                  objects, including a general distinction between
                  aggregation reference and association reference, and
                  introduction of type inheritance into aggregation
                  hierarchies and a support for combination of
                  aggregation inheritance with subtype inheritance.
                  Based on the extensions, we develop a query algebra
                  as an integral part of the model. Unlike most of
                  existing algebra-based query languages, our object
                  algebra takes complex object collectively as a unit
                  of high level queries and allows complex objects to
                  be accessed at all levels of aggregation hierarchies
                  without having resort to any king of path
                  expressions. Features of aggregation hierarchies,
                  such as acyclicity and aggregation inheritance, have
                  played important roles in such a development. We
                  have also formally described the output type of each
                  operator in order for dynamic classification of
                  query results in the IsA type/class lattice.
                  Although the design is based on the chosen
                  object-oriented model, other object-oriented
                  databases are possible. We feel that the proposal
                  largely covers the query requirements for complex
                  objects, and meanwhile provides users with an
                  opportunity to remain within the framework of the
                  model of complex objects while querying database. As
                  a consequence, the flexibility and adaptability of
                  the object-oriented model against schema changes are
                  increased.},

	Abstract = {A great deal of attention has lately been given to addressing software
	bugs such as errors in operating system drivers or security bugs.
	However, there are many other lesser known errors specific to individual
	applications or APIs and these violations of application specific
	coding rules are responsible for a multitude of errors. In this paper
	we propose DynaMine, a tool that analyzes source code check-ins to
	find highly correlated method calls as well as common bug fixes in
	order to automatically discover application-specific coding patterns.
	Potential patterns discovered through mining are passed to a dynamic
	analysis tool for validation; finally, the results of dynamic analysis
	are presented to the user.
	The combination of revision history mining and dynamic analysis techniques
	leveraged in DynaMine proves effective for both discovering new application-specific
	patterns and for finding errors when applied to very large applications
	with many man-years of development and debugging effort behind them.
	We have analyzed Eclipse and jEdit, two widely-used, mature, highly
	extensible applications consisting of more than 3,600,000 lines of
	code combined. By mining revision histories, we have discovered 56
	previously unknown, highly application-specific patterns. Out of
	these, 21 were dynamically confirmed as very likely valid patterns
	and a total of 263 pattern violations were found.},

	Abstract = {In vielen Unternehmen werden Datenbanksysteme
                  eingesetzt, um wichtige Unternehmensdaten zu
                  speichern und zu verwalten. Das Bed{\"u}rfnis,
                  Ablaufe automatisieren zu k{\"o}nnen, hat dazu
                  gef{\"u}hrt, dass Datenbanksysteme, die nur zur
                  Speicherung von Daten eingesetzt werden, nicht mehr
                  den Anforderungen gen{\"u}gen. Aus diesem Grund
                  werden seit einigen Jahren auf dem Gebiet der Daten-
                  banken Losungen gesucht, um den neuen Anforderungen
                  gerecht zu werden. Eine m{\"o}gliche Losung bieten
                  aktive Datenbanksysteme. Diese besitzen die
                  Eigenschaft, dass sie auf bestimmte Situationen
                  automatisch reagieren k{\"o}nnen. Ein solches
                  Verhalten wird als aktiv bezeichnet und kann mit
                  Hilfe von Regeln beschrieben werden. In diesen
                  werden die Situationen spezi ziert, die erkannt
                  werden mussen, und Aktionen festgelegt, die beim
                  Eintreten dieser Situationen ausgef{\"u}hrt werden.
                  In diesem Zusammenhang ergeben sich neue Aufgaben,
                  die eine Losung erfordern. So muss festgelegt
                  werden, wie aktives Verhalten mit Hilfe von Regeln
                  realisiert werden kann. Dazu muss spezi ziert
                  werden, wie Regeln in einem ADBS modelliert und
                  verarbeitet werden k{\"o}nnen. Diese Diplomarbeit
                  befasst sich mit der Modellierung, der Analyse sowie
                  der Simulation von Regeln in der aktiven Schicht
                  ALFRED (Active Layer For Rule Execution in Database
                  Systems). Diese Schicht kann auf prinzipiell
                  beliebige konventionelle (passive) Datenbanksysteme
                  aufgesetzt werden und erweitert diese um
                  Funktionalit{\"a}t en, mit denen aktives Verhalten
                  realisierbar ist. In dieser Schicht werden Regeln
                  mit all ihren Komponenten gesamthaft in einem
                  einzigen Modell dargestellt.},

                  position and arity of parameters. In order to
                  address this issue, we have defined lambdaF, a

	Abstract = {In recent years considerable progress has been made
                  to facilitate the specification and implementation
                  of software components. However, it is far less
                  clear what kind of language support is needed to
                  enable a flexible and reliable software composition
                  approach. Object-oriented programming languages seem
                  to already offer some reasonable support for
                  component-based programming (e.g., encapsulation of
                  state and behavior, inheritance, late binding).
                  Unfortunately, these languages typically provide
                  only a fixed and restricted set of mechanisms for
                  constructing and composing compositional
                  abstractions. In this article, we will present a
                  generic meta-level framework for modeling both
                  object- and component-oriented programming
                  abstractions. In this framework, various features,
                  which are typically merged in traditional
                  object-oriented programming languages, are all
                  replaced by a single concept: the composition of
                  forms. Forms are first-class, immutable, extensible
                  records that allow for the specification of
                  compositional abstractions in a language-neutral and
                  robust way. Thus, using the meta-level framework, we
                  can define a compositional model that provides the
                  means both to bridge between different object models
                  and to incorporate existing software artifacts into
                  a unified composition system.},

                  which objects and related software abstractions are

	Abstract = {Present-day applications are increasingly required
                  to be flexible, or "open" in a variety of ways. By
                  flexibility we mean that these applications have to
                  be portable (to different hardware and software
                  platforms), interoperable (with other applications),
                  extendible (to new functionality), configurable (to
                  individual users' or clients' needs), and
                  maintainable. These kinds of flexibility are
                  currently best supported by component-oriented
                  software technology: components, by means of
                  abstraction, support portability, interoperability,
                  and maintainability. Extendibility and
                  configurability are supported by different forms of
                  binding technology, or "glue": application parts, or
                  even whole applications can be created by composing
                  software components; applications stay flexible by
                  allowing components to be replaced or reconfigured,
                  possibly at runtime. This thesis develops a formal
                  language for software composition that is based on
                  the Pi-calculus. More precisely, we present the
                  L-calculus, a variant of the Pi-calculus in which
                  agents communicate by passing extensible, labeled
                  records, or so-called "forms", rather than tuples.
                  This approach makes it much easier to model
                  compositional abstractions than it is possible in
                  the plain Pi-calculus, since the contents of
                  communication are now independent of position,
                  agents are more naturally polymorphic since
                  communication forms can be easily extended, and
                  environmental arguments can be passed implicitly.
                  The L-calculus is developed in three stages: (i) we
                  analyse whether the Pi-calculus is suitable to model
                  composition abstractions, (ii) driven by the
                  insights we got using the Pi-calculus, we de ne a
                  new calculus that has better support for software
                  composition (e.g., provides support for inherently
                  extensible software construction), and (iii), we de
                  ne a first-order type system with subtype
                  polymorphism and sound record concatenation that
                  allows us to check statically an agent system in
                  order to prevent the occurrences of run-time errors.
                  We conclude with defining a first Java-based
                  composition system and Piccola, a prototype
                  composition language based on the L-calculus. The
                  composition system provides support for integrating
                  arbitrary compositional abstractions using both
                  Piccola and standard bridging technologies like RMI
                  and CORBA. Furthermore, the composition systems
                  maintains a composition library that provides
                  components in a uniform way.},

                  which is concerned with maintaining and improving
                  existing software systems. Reengineering is also a
                  process, the process by which such systems get to be
                  understood, improved and extended. Part of this
                  process is another process, the so called reverse
                  engineering. In reverse engineering man tries to
                  understand the existing software system. There are
                  different approaches to this task. Several of these
                  approaches are based on metrics. One such approach
                  is the detection strategies, a mechanism which makes
                  use of compositions of metrics. The detection
                  strategies offer a means for detecting design flaws
                  in software artifacts by filtering a given set
                  according to its property of respecting a certain
                  design rule. The detection strategies have proved to
                  be useful in detecting flaws in software systems,
                  and this is an important step in the process of
                  reverse engineering. However their mechanism of
                  filtering does not make any difference between the
                  different degrees of conformity to the rule by which
                  the filtering is made. To address this, we introduce
                  in this work the conformity strategies, a mechanism
                  who's main purpose is to compute the degree of
                  conformity of the software artifacts to specific
                  design rules. As an application of the conformity
                  expressions we develop a visualization technique
                  called the Magnet View. It visually presents
                  information about the software artifacts by letting
                  them interact with their properties after laws
                  derived from the equivalent physical laws of

                  abstractions (e.g., package structure, clustered

                  as a way of providing a visual and interactive
                  process for architecture recovery. During the
                  exploration process, the user navigates through
                  various views on the system by choosing from several
                  exploration operations. Although some sequences of
                  these operations lead to views which, from the
                  architectural point of view, are mode relevant than
                  others, current tools do not provide a way of
                  predicting which exploration paths are worth taking
                  and which are not. In this article we propose a set

	Abstract = {Reverse engineering and software evolution research
                  has been focused mostly on analyzing single software
                  systems. However, rarely a project exists in
                  isolation; instead, projects exist in parallel
                  within a larger context given by a company, a
                  research group or the open-source community.
                  Technically, such a context manifests itself in the
                  form of super-repositories, containers of several
                  projects developed in parallel. Well-known examples
                  of such super-repositories include SourceForge and
                  CodeHaus. We present an easily accessible platform
                  which supports the analysis of such
                  super-repositories. The platform can be valuable for
                  reverse engineering both the projects and the
                  structure of the organization as reflected in the
                  interactions and collaborations between developers.
                  Throughout the paper we present various types of
                  analysis applied to three open-source and one
                  industrial Smalltalk super-repositories, containing
                  hundreds of projects developed by dozens of people.},

To recover the dependencies, fact extractors ana- lyze the system as a whole and build the dependency graph, parsing the system down to the statement level. At the level of software ecosystems, which are collections of soft- ware projects, the dependencies that need to be recovered reside not only within the individual systems, but also be- tween the libraries, frameworks, and entire software systems that make up the complete ecosystem; scaling issues arise.
		In this paper we present and evaluate several variants of a lightweight and scalable approach to recover dependencies between the software projects of an ecosystem. We evaluate our recovery algorithms on the Squeak 3.10 Universe, an ecosystem containing more than 200 software projects.},

	Abstract = {Under many circumstances, the development of
                  distributed applications greatly benefits from
                  mechanisms like process groups, reliable ordered
                  multicast, and message passing. However, toolkits
                  offering these capabilities are often low-level and
                  therefore difficult to program. To ease the
                  development of distributed applications, in this
                  paper we propose to hide these low-level functions
                  behind object-oriented abstractions such as
                  object-groups, Remote Method Calling , and Smart
                  Proxies. Furthermore, we describe how the Electra
                  toolkit provides such object-oriented abstractions
                  in a portable and highly machine-independent way.},

	Abstract = {Statically-typed object-oriented compiled languages,
                  like Simula, Beta, Eiffel, are desirable because of
                  the safety and efficiency of the resulting code.
                  Dynamically-typed, interpreted languages, like
                  Smalltalk, are useful as they provide the
                  possibility of dynamically extending a program. In
                  this paper, we reconcile the safety and efficiency
                  goals of compiled languages with the benefits of
                  interpreted languages by presenting an embeddable
                  interpreter for a compiled language, namely Beta.
                  The interpreter is designed to be embedded into any
                  compiled Beta application, thus enabling it to
                  accept dynamic extensions. This paper examines the
                  Application Programmer's Interface to the
                  interpreter and illustrate some aspects of our

@techreport{Malor99a,
	Abstract = {Duploc is a tool written in Smalltalk, which is
                  currently under continuous development inside the
                  Software Composition Group at the University of
                  Bern. It is designed for representing graphically
                  the comparison results of found duplicated lines of
                  code out of a set of loaded source code files.
                  Duploc supports different programming languages
                  (C++, C, Java, Smalltalk etc.). The loaded files are
                  compared line-by-line using a simple string-match
                  comparison function--the comparison results are
                  stored in a two dimensional comparison matrix. The
                  previous Graphical User Interface (GUI) represents
                  the obtained comparison matrix as a dotplot
                  diagram---in this two dimensional grid of black
                  painted dots, each dot stands for two identical
                  found lines of code in two different files. This GUI
                  uses a scrollbar to provide some navigation facility
                  over the comparison matrix. It is therefore only
                  suitable for visualising comparison matrixes up to
                  some hundred elements per matrix side (e.g.
                  800x800). The project goal was to integrate into the
                  Duploc application a technique named Information
                  Mural in order to visualise a large comparison
                  matrix. Figure 2 shows the Information Mural
                  overview image of a comparison matrix with
                  24278x24278 elements. This image was produced with
                  the new developed GUI. Each dot stands for the
                  'match density' inside a correspondent region in the
                  underlying comparison matrix. Darker dots indicates
                  a region of the comparison matrix with more matches
                  then lighter dots. This new developed GUI is
                  typically capable to visualise a comparison matrix
                  with up to two million elements per side. It also
                  provides navigation facilities for exploring parts
                  of the comparison matrix in a dotplot like display
                  mode.},

@inproceedings{Mari05a,
	Abstract = {To automatically analyze the code, the analyses must
                  be implemented as software programs. As analyses
                  become increasingly complex, implementing them using
                  imperative and interrogative programming is
                  oftentimes cumbersome. Consequently, the
                  understanding, testing and reuse of analyses is
                  severely hampered. In this paper we identify a set
                  of key mechanisms that are involved in the
                  implementation of any static analysis: navigation,
                  selection, set arithmetics, filtering and property
                  aggregation. We show that neither of the
                  aforementioned approaches offers a simple support
                  for these mechanisms and, as a result, an
                  undesirable overhead of complexity is added to the
                  implementation of most analyses. The paper
                  introduces SAIL, a language designed to offer a
                  proper support to a simplify writing of analyses. In
                  order to validate the expressiveness of SAIL the
                  paper provides a comprehensive comparison with the
                  other two approaches.},

	Abstract = {In the last years, as object-oriented software
                  systems became more and more complex, the need of
                  performing automatically reverse engineering upon
                  these systems has increased significantly. This
                  applies also to enterprise applications, a novel
                  category of software systems. As it is well known,
                  one step toward a research infrastructure
                  accelerating the progress of reverse engineering is
                  the creation of an intermediate representation of
                  software systems. This paper shows why existing
                  intermediate representations of object-oriented
                  software are not suitable for performing reverse
                  engineering upon enterprise applications and
                  proposes an intermediate representation (a model)
                  for enterprise applications which facilitates the
                  process of reverse engineering upon this type of
                  applications. Based on an experimental study
                  conducted on three enterprise applications, we prove
                  the reliability of the introduced approach, discuss
                  its benefits and touch the issues that need to be
                  addressed in the future.},

                  methods a test focuses. Sometimes it is obvious, but
                  there are cases where we cannot say on which methods
                  a test focuses. Among others we observed two test
                  patterns that look similar but are the inverse of
                  each other. The first consists of an initial setup
                  method and then focuses on one or several methods.
                  The second one invokes the focused method first and
                  then uses accessors to test the side effects. As a
                  result there are no established and foolproof ways
                  to detect the methods under test automatically. In
                  the following we discuss several different,
                  automated ways of detecting the methods under test.
                  Because there are no rules to determine the methods
                  under test, automatically detecting them can never
                  be fully accurate. But we search for different
                  approaches and try to find out how effective they
                  are. First we present several different ways to
                  annotate a test with its methods under test and
                  choose one of them to annotate the tests of some
                  case studies. We also build a tool that allows us to
                  query these methods and their annotations. Afterward
                  we describe ways to automatically detect the methods
                  under test. The first one called NameAnalyzer looks
                  at the names of tests and test cases and uses naming
                  conventions to determine the methods under test. We
                  also parse the source code of a test and try to
                  extract all methods the test directly invokes.
                  Because this results in a lot of false positives we
                  build a heuristic extension to reduce this noise. We
                  run each of these approaches for analysis on some
                  case studies and validate their output against the
                  annotations described in the first section. Finally
                  we discuss these results, judge the approaches by
                  how effective they are in detecting the methods
                  under test, and conclude.},

@mastersthesis{Mars06a,
	Abstract = {Smalltalk traditionally has good support for
                  structural reflection. This comes from the fact that
                  classes are first class, high level objects. This
                  reflection support has allowed Smalltalk
                  implementations to build tools decades ago that
                  surpass those of many other languages today. These
                  tools are basically a user interface for
                  introspection and intercession. The reflective
                  facilities of Smalltalk are not only used by tools
                  but also by Smalltalk developers for
                  metaprogramming. However the Smalltalk reflection
                  support stops at the method border. The only first
                  class models for reflection at the sub-method level
                  Smalltalk supports are collections of bytes or
                  characters. This prevents tools from truly looking
                  into the method and makes it hard to create a new
                  generation of tools that go beyond the five pane
                  browser and work at the sub-method level. It also
                  prevents Smalltalk developers from doing
                  metaprogramming at a sub-method level. We present
                  reflective methods: a first class, high level
                  abstraction of a method that supports rich
                  structural reflection at the sub-method level and
                  show how it eases metaprogramming and the creation
                  of tools at the sub-method level such as a pluggable
                  type checker.},

@techreport{McHa94a,
	Abstract = {It is commonly believed that access to the instance
                  variables of an object by its synchronisation code
                  is needed in order to implement many synchronisation
                  policies. This introduces an obvious difficulty. The
                  synchronisation code must not read an instance
                  variable while that variable is being updated by an
                  operation, otherwise the synchronisation code might
                  see the variable in an inconsistent state. In this
                  paper, we study this problem in depth and solve it
                  by defining a framework to guide the design of
                  synchronisation mechanisms. In solving the problem,
                  our framework illustrates that, contrary to popular
                  belief, access to instance variables by
                  synchronisation mechanisms is {\em not\/} required
                  in order to implement synchronisation policies that
                  apparently rely on the state of the object---such
                  state can be maintained by the synchronisation code
                  itself. Our framework offers additional benefits.
                  Synchronisation mechanisms designed within the
                  guidelines of the framework can possess considerable
                  expressive power. (The example synchronisation
                  mechanism we present subsumes the power of numerous
                  other synchronisation mechanisms.) Also, we show
                  that most of the concepts of our framework can be
                  implemented in terms of existing language
                  constructs, thus minimising complexity that needs to
                  be added to a sequential language in order to
                  support concurrency.},

	Abstract = {Clustering helps with reengineering by gathering the
                  software entities into meaningful and independent
                  groups. The entities here can be any FAMIX entities,
                  be it classes, methods, attributes etc. The affinity
                  between two entities is calculated through the
                  absolute difference of their properties and
                  properties of the dependencies between the two
                  entities; all the properties also have assigned
                  weights. The clustering can be done by a range of
                  clustering algorithms, including hierarchical and
                  partitional algorithms. The result are groups of
                  clusters, that can be examined through their quality
                  metrics and if necessarily improved upon through
                  another clustering run with adapted parameters. This

                  frameworks is done at a rela- tively low abstraction
                  level, leaving a large gap with the high abstraction
                  level of a de- sign. This makes the use of a
                  framework difficult, and allows design and
                  realization to diverge. Design patterns are more
                  specific elements of design, and thus reduce this
                  gap. We even bridge this gap by making design
                  patterns and the classes that play a role within
                  them into special purpose software components.
                  System realization becomes a matter of composing
                  special purpose class-components. We also introduce
                  a system, FACE, which supports the visual

                  advantage of having a high-abstraction level of
                  describing a system and the possibility of coupling
                  these abstractions to some underlying
                  implementation. Still, all cur-rent tools are based
                  on generating source code in which the design
                  patterns become implicit. After that, further
                  extension and adaptation of the software is needed
                  but this can no longer be supported at the same
                  level of abstraction. This paper presents FACE, an
                  environment based on an explicit representa-tion of

                  designed to work together as part of a component
                  framework that formalizes a class of applications
                  with a common software architecture. To enable such
                  a view of software systems, we need appropriate
                  support from programming language technology,
                  software tools, and methods. We will briefly review

                  (object-oriented) program in terms of logic clauses.
                  We declare programming patterns as logic rules on

                  these rules allow us to check, enforce and search

                  engineering for several reasons, among which quality
                  assessment and improvement of development team
                  productivity. While the mathematical nature of
                  metrics calls for clear definitions, frequently
                  there exist many contradicting definitions of the
                  same metric depending on the implementation
                  language. We suggest to express and define metrics
                  using a language-independent metamodel based on
                  graphs. This graph-based approach allows for an
                  unambiguous definition of generic object-oriented
                  metrics and higher-order metrics. We also report on
                  some prototype tools that implement these ideas.},

	Abstract = {The inheritance anomaly refers to the serious
                  difficulty in combining inheritance and concurrency
                  in a simple and satisfactory way within a concurrent
                  object-oriented language. The problem is closely
                  connected with the need to impose synchronization
                  constraints on the acceptance of a message by an
                  object. In most concurrent object-oriented languages
                  this synchronization is achieved by synchronization
                  code controlling the acceptance of messages by
                  objects. Synchronization code is often hard to
                  inherit and tends to require extensive
                  redefinitions. The solutions that have appeared so
                  far in the literature to alleviate this problem seem
                  to implicitly assume that better, more reusable,
                  mechanisms are needed to create and structure
                  synchronization code. The approach taken in this
                  paper is to consider the inheritance anomaly as a
                  problem caused by the very presence of
                  synchronization code. The goal is then to completely
                  eliminate synchronization code. This is achieved by
                  using order-sorted rewriting logic, an abstract
                  model of concurrent computation that is
                  machine-independent and extremely fine grain, and
                  that can be used directly to program concurrent
                  object-oriented systems. Our proposed solution
                  involves a distinction between two different notions
                  of inheritance, a type-theoretic one called class
                  inheritance, and a notion called module inheritance
                  that supports reuse and modification of code. These
                  two different notions address two different ways in
                  which the inheritance anomaly can appear; for each
                  of them we propose declarative solutions in which no
                  explicit synchronization code is ever used.},

	Abstract = {Generalized digital images, subsequently called
                  hyperimages, represent a variation of the
                  conventional digital images which implies pixels of
                  different dimensions within the same image. The
                  extent of a hyperimage is the disjoint union of all
                  pixel extents it contains, which are relatively open
                  unit cubes with respect to the euclidean topology of
                  the underlying space. This approach is independent
                  of any specific dimension of image and space,
                  respectively, and allows strict partitioning of
                  images into subimages, not just subdividing. Since
                  the storage required by a $d$-dimensional hyperimage
                  of resolution $n^d$ is $\approx 2^{d}n^{d}$ when
                  using a binary matrix representation, a more space
                  efficient bintree representation is investigated.

                  characteristic) are presented. Because of the nature

                  day that they manifest. This makes fixing the bug a
                  lot easier since the developers know where to look
                  for the bug and they still know why they introduced
                  the changes that lead to the bug. The target of
                  Merlin is to provide a slim Continuous Integration
                  tool for Smal ltalk. Merlin was designed to be
                  extendable with custom plugins. The author is of the
                  opinion that a Continous Integration tool only
                  offers a real surplus if all repetitive and mostly
                  cumbersome tasks of the development process can be
                  handled by the tool.},

	Abstract = {Data visualization is the process of representing
                  data as pictures to support reasoning about the
                  underlying data. For the interpretation to be as
                  easy as possible, we need to be as close as possible
                  to the original data. As most visualization tools
                  have an internal meta-model, which is different from
                  the one for the presented data, they usually need to
                  duplicate the original data to conform to their
                  meta-model. This leads to an increase in the
                  resources needed, increase which is not always
                  justified. In this work we argue for the need of
                  having an engine that is as close as possible to the
                  data and we present our solution of moving the
                  visualization tool to the data, instead of moving
                  the data to the visualization tool. Our solution
                  also emphasizes the necessity of reusing basic
                  blocks to express complex visualizations and
                  allowing the programmer to script the visualization
                  using his preferred tools, rather than a third party
                  format. As a validation of the expressiveness of our
                  framework, we show how we express several already
                  published visualizations and describe the pros and
                  cons of the approach.},

	Abstract = {Data visualization is an important tool in reverse
                  engineering. With a good visualization the
                  interesting parts of the underlying data can be
                  detected faster than by merely inspecting the raw
                  data. One peculiarity of the existing visualization
                  tools is the fact that they implement a finite set
                  of specific visualizations. These specialized tools
                  are not flexible enough to support the user when a
                  slightly or sometimes even drastically different
                  visualization is needed. Often the user needs to be
                  familiar with several visualization tools with each
                  tool expecting a different input format. Usually a
                  large amount of time is being invested into
                  converting the data into the format that is expected
                  by the visualization tool. We propose a new
                  visualization model that is designed to minimize the
                  time-to-solution. We achieve this by working
                  directly on the underlying data, by making nesting
                  an integral part of the model and by defining a
                  powerful scripting language that can be used to
                  define visualizations. We support exploring data in
                  an interactive way by providing hooks for various
                  events. Users can register actions for these events
                  in the visualization script. As a validation of our
                  model we implemented the framework Mondrian and used
                  it to implement several established visualizations.},

	Abstract = {Multimethods offer several well-known advantages
                  over the single dispatching of conventional
                  object-oriented languages, including a simple
                  solution to the "binary method" problem, cleaner
                  implementations of the "visitor," "strategy," and
                  similar design patterns, and a form of "open
                  objects." However, previous work on statically typed
                  multimethods whose arguments are treated
                  symmetrically has required the whole program to be
                  available in order to perform typechecking. We
                  describe Dubious, a simple core language including
                  first-class generic functions with symmetric
                  multimethods, a classless object model, and modules
                  that can be separately typechecked. We identify two
                  sets of restrictions that ensure modular type safety
                  for Dubious as well as an interesting intermediate
                  point between these two. We have proved each of
                  these modular type systems sound.},

                  allows processes to communicate without knowing each
                  other's identities and without having to arrange for
                  a definite rendezvous. This high level of
                  abstraction would make Linda particularly suitable
                  for use as a coordination model for open systems, if
                  it were not for the fact that the Linda
                  communication is very unsafe. We propose to remove
                  this deficiency of Linda by means of the concept of
                  law-governed architecture previously applied to
                  centralized and message passing systems. We define a
                  model for Law-Governed Linda (LGL) communication,
                  and we demonstrate its efficacy by means of several

@article{Mira05a,
	Abstract = {While development of a software system is important,
                  it is also very important to have suitable
                  mechanisms for actually deploying code. Current
                  state-of-the-art deployment approaches force the
                  developer to structure the code in such a way that
                  deployment is possible, thereby severely inhibiting
                  reuse and comprehensibility of the system. This
                  paper presents parcels, an atomic deployment
                  mechanism for objects and source code that supports
                  shape changing of classes, method addition, method
                  replacement, and partial loading. The key to making
                  this deployment mechanism feasible and fast is a
                  pickling algorithm that allows the unpickling to be
                  done iteratively instead of with a recursive descent
                  parser. Parcels were developed for VisualWorks
                  Smalltalk, and have been the default deployment
                  mechanism the past years for thousands of
                  customers.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a framework and some techniques
                  used in the construction of integrated and
                  extensible programming environments. To support
                  programming in complex object-oriented languages
                  such as C++, a database that contains semantic
                  information on the source programs is essential.
                  Tools in such environments should be constructed in
                  a highly integrated fashion around the database. In
                  addition, new programming techniques and the
                  acquisition of knowledge through experience create a
                  need for extensions. Such environments have to be
                  designed so that extensions can be made easily. Thus
                  integration and extensibility are key features of
                  such environments.},

@phdthesis{Moon90a,
	Abstract = {Many second language instructional texts are written
                  in a format in which the learner is presented with
                  an instruction followed by a set of examples. This
                  thesis discusses the roles played by both
                  instruction and examples in learning from such a
                  text and gives functional reasons of why both forms
                  of input are necessary. A computer model of second
                  language learning, called ANT, was built to
                  investigate these roles. Input to the system is
                  similar to what is found in an instructional text.
                  ANT's learning with this input is compared to two
                  alternatives: learning from only examples and
                  learning from only instructions. I discuss why, from
                  a functional or processing standpoint, learning from
                  a mixed input is more effective than either of the
                  alternatives. An empirical comparison was done of
                  ANT's performance on input containing instructions
                  and examples versus performance of the system when
                  given instructions only or examples only. The
                  results of the comparison support the hypothesis as
                  to the utility of mixed input. In addition, a
                  psychological experiment was done with human
                  subjects, the results of which justified the
                  hypotheses of the ANT model. Through the study it
                  was found that the roles instructions play are that
                  they: (1) focus the learner's attention on the
                  nature of the difference between the native and
                  second language; (2) focus the learner's attention
                  on features in the examples relevant to those
                  changes; (3) tell the learner how far the rule can
                  be generalized; (4) allow the learner to alter
                  expectations about the second language input; and
                  (5) tell the learner to which rules the change
                  applies. The roles examples play are that they: (1)
                  help to identify relevant previous knowledge; (2)
                  help to form the new rules; and (3) provide details
                  essential to the rule which are omitted in the
                  instruction. The study also discusses constraints
                  which language learning puts on knowledge
                  representation.},

	Abstract = {In this technical report we show how to produce a
                  parser for the Ada 83 programming language. It
                  features general ideas about parsing and the parser
                  definitions for main parts of Ada 83. Using SmaCC
                  (Smalltalk Compiler Compiler), a
                  LR-parser-generator, we produce different parsers
                  which are able to parse different parts or also the
                  full language. Our SmaCC-version runs in VisualWorks
                  Smalltalk and we show how our parsers are compiled
                  there, how one can use Smalltalk programming to
                  produce a syntax tree out of the source code and
                  also fetch and process the structure of these codes.
                  The structure and corresponding contents is imported
                  as models into Moose - a tool to measure, analyze,
                  visualize and reengineer legacy applications written
                  in different programming languages in a abstracted
                  way using their concrete model. And there is a
                  discussion about problems one encounters when trying
                  to find exact machine-directives to parse texts in
                  general, how one may fix them and what specific
                  problems arised while this project.},

                  a formal mapping between architectures that is
                  decomposed into generic and architecture-specific
                  parts. The semantics of architectural connections is
                  defined in terms of Lamport's temporal logic of
                  actions, and proofs of both safety and fairness are

                  Technology has shown that the availability (or
                  absence) of reusable frameworks has substantial
                  productivity impacts. This can make it more
                  difficult to reliably estimate the size and cost of
                  such projects early in the software process. The
                  newly proposed System Meter method tackles this
                  problem by distinguishing functionality to be
                  implemented from functionality supported by reusable
                  components. It therefore yields more uniform and
                  predictable productivity measures. Moreover, it can
                  also be applied already after a preliminary analysis
                  phase, in contrast to the more traditional Function
                  Points approach.},

	Abstract = {We present the implementation of Moostrap, a
                  reflective prototype-based language, the interpreter
                  of which is written in Scheme. Moostrap is based on
                  a reduced number of primitives, according to a
                  previous work for defining a taxonomy for
                  prototype-based languages. Our purpose is to reify
                  the behavior of any object through two steps: the
                  slot lookup and its application. The first phase is
                  reified thanks to \fIbehavioral metaobjects\fR, and
                  the second is managed by special objects, called
                  \fIslot-executants\fR. This kernel does not handle
                  any implicit delegation at first. However, we
                  introduce it, as s first extension of the basic
                  language using a new behavioral meta-object.},

@inproceedings{Mull05a,
	Abstract = {Nowadays, object-oriented meta-languages such as MOF
                  (Meta- Object Facility) are increasingly used to
                  specify domain-specific languages in the
                  model-driven engineering community. However, these
                  meta-languages focus on structural specifications
                  and have no built-in support for specifications of
                  operational semantics. In this paper we explore the
                  idea of using aspectoriented modeling to add precise
                  action specifications with static type checking and
                  genericity at the meta level, and examine related
                  issues and possible solutions. We believe that such
                  a combination would bring significant benefits to
                  the community, such as the specification, simulation
                  and testing of operational semantics of metamodels.
                  We present requirements for such statically-typed
                  meta-languages and rationales for the aforementioned
                  benefits.},

@inproceedings{Nebb98n,
	Abstract = {This position paper is based on work recovering
                  architectures from object-oriented systems in the
                  context of the FAMOOS Esprit project. Our experience
                  corroborates the existence of aspects that cross-cut
                  the functionality of a software system. However,
                  when examining how the problems arising from such a
                  situation are dealt with in Ada where the language
                  has built-in support for concurrency and C++ where
                  no such support exists suggests the possibility of a
                  more general approach to aspect-oriented programming
                  based on the following hypothesis about software
                  structure that so far has proven to be correct. "A
                  software system can be structured as a set of
                  independent semantic domains consisting of a core
                  problem domain and a set of coordinated supporting
                  domains." I will use the term semantics to refer to
                  an axiomatic or denotational notions of semantics
                  where only the result is considered as semantically
                  relevant as opposed to an operational notion of
                  semantics where how the result was obtained is
                  equally important. I will also use the term
                  coordination to mean the linking of actions or
                  instances from different semantic domains. This is a
                  very general notion of coordination of which the
                  more traditional use of coordination in relation to
                  concurrency is an example.},

	Abstract = {{Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack against web applications in which scripting code is injected into the output of an application that is then sent to a user's web browser. In the browser, this scripting code is executed and used to transfer sensitive data to a third party (i.e., the attacker). Currently, most approaches attempt to prevent XSS on the server side by inspecting and modifying the data that is exchanged between the web application and the user. Unfortunately, it is often the case that vulnerable applications are not fixed for a considerable amount of time, leaving the users vulnerable to attacks. The solution presented in this paper stops XSS attacks on the client side by tracking the flow of sensitive information inside the web browser. If sensitive information is about to be transferred to a third party, the user can decide if this should be permitted or not. As a result, the user has an additional protection layer when surfing the web, without solely depending on the security of the web application}},

                  process for journal publications in other domains.
                  The programme committee for such a conference will
                  typically convene at a meeting, where submitted

                  presentation at the conference. Experience shows
                  that discussions are more focussed, and the entire
                  process runs more smoothly if most of the time is
                  devoted to those papers that are actually

                  changing requirements. The complexity of software
                  evolution can, however, be significantly reduced if
                  we manage to separate the stable artifacts (the

                  We have proposed a simple, unifying framework of

                  and scripts, and we have developed an experimental

	Abstract = {Moore's Law is pushing us inevitably towards a world
                  of pervasive, wireless, spontaneously networked
                  computing devices. Whatever these devices do, they
                  will have to talk to and negotiate with one another,
                  and so software agents will have to represent them.
                  Whereas conventional services on intranets will
                  continue to be distributed using established
                  middleware standards, internet services are being
                  built on top of http, wap or other protocols, and
                  exchange information in HTML, XML and just about
                  anything that can be wrapped as a MIME type or
                  streamed. This situation leads us to three software
                  problems: (i) How can we simplify the task of
                  programming these agents? (i.e., {Java} is not
                  enough), (ii) How can agents interact and
                  interoperate in an open, evolving network
                  environment? (i.e., XML is not enough), (iii) How
                  can we reason about the services that agents provide
                  and use? (i.e., IDL is not enough). We discuss these
                  questions in the context of our work on Piccola, a
                  small composition language, and outline ongoing and
                  further research.},

                  important when it is used to separate stable from
                  flexible parts of software systems to reduce the
                  complexity of software evolution. We encapsulate the

                  constant challenge in such environments to ensure
                  that software components are safely composed in the
                  face of changing dependencies and incomplete
                  knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a new
                  kind of type system which allows us to infer not
                  only the type provided by a software component in an
                  open system, but also the type it requires of its
                  environment, subject to certain constraints. The
                  contractual type we infer for components can then be
                  statically checked when components are composed. To
                  illustrate our approach, we introduce the form
                  calculus, a calculus of explicit environments, and

                  instantiation (do components exist at run-time or

                  and harder to understand and maintain. Certain
                  reverse engineering techniques attempt to
                  reconstruct software models from source code with
                  the help of a parser for the source language.
                  Unfortunately a great deal of effort may be required
                  to build a specialized parser for a legacy
                  programming language or dialect. On the other hand,
                  (i) we typically do not need a complete parser that
                  recognizes all language constructs, and (ii) we have
                  a rich supply of (legacy) examples. We present an
                  approach to use these facts to rapidly and
                  incrementally develop parsers as follows: we specify
                  mappings from source code examples to model
                  elements; we use the mappings to generate a parser;
                  we parse as much code as we can; we use the

                  and we iterate. Experiments with Java and Ruby, two

                  today is how to gracefully evolve complex software
                  systems in the face of changing requirements. We
                  clearly need software systems to be more dynamic,
                  compositional and model-centric, but instead we
                  continue to build systems that are static, baroque
                  and inflexible. How can we better build
                  change-enabled systems in the future? To
                  answer this question, we propose to look back to one
                  of the most successful systems to support change,
                  namely Smalltalk. We briefly introduce Smalltalk
                  with a few simple examples, and draw some lessons
                  for software evolution. Smalltalk's simplicity, its
                  reflective design, and its highly dynamic nature all
                  go a long way towards enabling change in Smalltalk
                  applications. We then illustrate how these lessons
                  work in practice by reviewing a number of research
                  projects that support software evolution by
                  exploiting Smalltalk's design. We conclude by

	Abstract = {A message management system enables its users to
                  automatically process messages. Procedures
                  associated with a workstation may scan incoming
                  mail, perform some routine processing and possibly
                  forward the mail. The global properties of such
                  systems may be far from obvious when large numbers
                  of procedures are present. We attempt to gain
                  insight into global behaviour by studying "message
                  flow". We do so by partitioning message domains into
                  state-spaces, and analyzing the state transitions
                  effected by procedures. Message flow for messages of
                  a given type can thus be represented by a finite
                  automaton whose states are the message states. The
                  finite automata for the various message types can be
                  "welded together" to form a Petri net that
                  accurately captures both the message flow for
                  individual message types and the coordination by
                  procedures of messages of different types. The model
                  is useful for obtaining a descriptive analysis of
                  behaviour, and for analyzing interesting behaviour
                  such as blocking, deadlock, "message loops" and
                  "procedure loops". In addition we present some
                  techniques useful for detecting message loops and

                  object-oriented language as well of that of other
                  researchers, we have identified several key problems
                  in the design of a obc model compatible with the
                  mechanisms of object-oriented programming. We
                  propose an approach to language design in which an
                  executable notation describing the behaviour of
                  communicating agents is extended by syntactic
                  patterns that encapsulate language constructs. We
                  indicate how various language models can be
                  accommodated, and how mechanisms such as inheritance
                  can be modeled. Finally, we introduce a new notion
                  of types that characterizes concurrent objects in
                  terms of their externally visible behaviour.},

                  together with scripts that bind these objects
                  together to perform certain tasks. Scripting
                  encourages a component-oriented approach to
                  application development in which frameworks of
                  reusable components (objects and scripts) are
                  carefully engineered in an evolutionary software

                  to extend existing languages with object-oriented

                  languages with seemingly orthogonal features, such
                  as obc and persistence, to improve their expressive
                  power and potential as a solution to the "software

                  have uncovered various forms of semantic

                  that they must cope with open networks,
                  heterogeneous interoperable hardware and software
                  systems, and, above all, evolving and changing
                  requirements. The CHASSIS project aims to develop a
                  software and methodology framework for (i) the
                  security- and reliability-oriented systematic design
                  and construction of heterogeneous information
                  systems from individual existing and newly developed
                  application software components and database
                  systems, and (ii) their secure and reliable
                  interoperation. In CHASSIS, object-orientation is
                  the key technology for the construction of such a
                  system as its uniform interface is realized by an
                  object-oriented data model and the homogenization
                  layer is realized by object-oriented software.
                  CHASSIS includes object models for database and
                  language integration, software to support system
                  integration, specification methods to support the

	Abstract = {Many of the shortcomings of present-day
                  object-oriented programming languages can be traced
                  to two phenomena: (i) the lack of general support
                  for software composition, and (ii) the semantic
                  interference between language features addressing
                  operational and compositional aspects of
                  object-oriented programming. To remedy this
                  situation, we propose the development of a "pattern
                  language" for active objects in which objects and,
                  more generally, applications, are constructed by
                  composing software patterns. A "pattern" can be any
                  reusable software abstraction, including functions,
                  objects, classes and generics. In this paper we seek
                  to establish both informal requirements for a
                  pattern language and a formal basis for defining the
                  semantics of patterns. First, we identify some basic
                  requirements for supporting object composition and
                  we review the principal language design choices with
                  respect to these requirements. We then survey the
                  various problems of semantic interference in
                  existing languages. Next, we present a formal
                  "object calculus" and show how it can be used to
                  define the semantics of patterns in much the same
                  way that the lambda calculus can be used to give
                  meaning to constructs of functional programming
                  languages. We conclude by summarizing the principle
                  open problems that remain to define a practical
                  pattern language for active objects.},

	Abstract = {The key requirement for open systems is that they be
                  flexible, or recomposable. This suggests that they
                  must first of all be composable. Object-oriented
                  techniques help by allowing applications to be
                  viewed as compositions of collaborating objects, but
                  are limited in supporting other kinds of
                  abstractions that may have finer or coarser
                  granularity than objects. A composition language
                  supports the technical requirements of a
                  component-oriented development approach by shifting
                  emphasis from programming and inheritance of classes
                  to specification and composition of components.
                  Objects are viewed as processes, and components are
                  abstractions over the object space. An application
                  is viewed as an explicit composition of software
                  components. By making software architectures
                  explicit and manipulable, we expect to better
                  support application evolution and flexibility. In
                  this position paper we will elaborate our
                  requirements and outline a strategy for the design
                  and implementation of a composition language for the

                  that firstly it is an industry standard, and
                  secondly it has a standard plain text encoding which
                  tackles the requirements of convenient querying and
                  human readability. Next to that the CDIF framework

@inproceedings{Notk93a,
	Abstract = {Implicit invocation based on event announcement is
                  an increasingly important technique for integrating
                  systems. However, the use of this technique has
                  largely been confined to tool integration
                  systems---in which tools exist as independent
                  processes---and special purpose languages---in which
                  specialized forms of event broadcast are designed
                  into the language from the start. This paper
                  broadens the class of systems that can benefit from
                  this approach by showing how to augment
                  general-purpose programming languages with
                  facilities for implicit invocation. We illustrate
                  the approach in the context of three different
                  languages, Ada, C++, and Common Lisp. The intent is
                  to highlight the key design considerations that
                  arise in extending such languages with implicit
                  invocation.},

	Abstract = {There are many good reasons why organizations should
                  perform software architecture reconstructions.
                  However, few organizations are willing to pay for
                  the effort. Software architecture reconstruction
                  must be viewed not as an effort on its own but as a
                  contribution in a broader technical context, such as
                  the streamlining of products into a product line or
                  the modernization of systems that hit their
                  architectural borders, that is require major
                  restructuring. In this paper we propose the use of
                  architecture reconstruction to support System
                  Modernization through the identification and reuse
                  of legacy components as services in a Service-
                  Oriented Architecture (SOA). A case study showing
                  how architecture reconstruction was used on a system
                  to support an organization's decision-making process
                  is presented.},

	Abstract = {Research has shown that metalevel architectures and
                  the concept of reflection are useful for modifying
                  programming systems dynamically in a controlled way.
                  To modify the system flexibly, it is necessary to
                  represent various abstraction levels, from the
                  programing language level to the OS level, as well
                  as user's multiple views, such as the view where the
                  distributed environment is transparent and the view
                  where that is not transparent, in a programming
                  system. In traditional reflective systems, it is,
                  however, difficult to represent these aspects of the
                  system because these systems are modeled by one
                  metalevel. To overcome this problem, we have
                  proposed a new reflection framework: Multi-Model
                  Reflection Framework (MMRF), and implemented a
                  programming system AL-1/D based on this framework.
                  This paper gives a clearer definition of MMRF than
                  in our previous paper. MMRF is a framework for
                  decomposing a metalevel into multiple conceptual
                  models according to the abstraction levels and
                  user's views. These conceptual models may overlap
                  each other in their functions and resources. The
                  decomposed models should run concurrently because
                  models represents system components running
                  concurrently in a system. The definition of MMRF
                  includes the conditions to enable models to run
                  simultaneously without violenting consistently. The
                  structure of a model includes information to decide
                  whether or not these conditions are satisfied.},

@article{Ossh09a,
	Abstract = {The open source movement has made vast quantities of
                  source code available online for free, providing an
                  extremely large dataset for empirical study and
                  potential resuse. A major difficulty in exploiting
                  this potential fully is that the data are currently
                  scattered between competing source code
                  repositories, none of which are structured for
                  empirical analysis and cross-project comparison. As
                  a result, software researchers and developers are
                  left to compile their own datasets, resulting in
                  duplicated effort and limited results. To address
                  this challenge, we built SourcererDB, an aggregated
                  repository of statically analyzed and cross-linked
                  open source Java projects. SourcererDB contains
                  local snapshots of 2,852 Java projects taken from
                  Sourceforge, Apache and Java.net. These projects are
                  statically analyzed to extract rich structural
                  information, which is then stored in a relational
                  database. References to entities in the 16,058
                  external jars are resolved and grouped, allowing for
                  cross-project usage information to be accessed
                  easily. This paper describes: (a) the mechanism for
                  resolving and grouping these cross-project
                  references, (b) the structure of and the metamodel
                  for the SourcererDB repository, and (d) end-user
                  dataset access mechanisms. Our goal in building
                  SourcererDB is to provide a rich dataset of source
                  code to facilitate the sharing of extracted data and
                  to encourage reuse and repeatability of
                  experiments.},

                  maintenance. Dedicated data structures have been
                  used to support either textual or structural queries
                  over source code. The goal of this ongoing research
                  is to elaborate a hybrid data storage that enables
                  simultaneous textual and structural search. The
                  naive adjacency list method has been combined with
                  the inverted index approach. The data model has been
                  enhanced with the use of data compression approaches
                  for column-oriented databases to allow no-loss
                  albeit compact storage of fine-grained structural
                  data. The graph indexing has enabled the proposed
                  data model to expeditiously answer fine-grained
                  structural queries. This paper describes the basics
                  of the proposed approach and estimates its
                  feasibility.},

	Abstract = {There is considerable interest in programs that can
                  migrate from one host to another and execute. Mobile
                  programs are appealing because they support
                  efficient utilization of network resources and
                  extensibility of information servers. However, since
                  they cross administrative domains, they have the
                  ability to access and possibly misuse a host's
                  protected resources. In this paper, we present a
                  novel approach for controlling and protecting a
                  site's resources. In this approach, a site uses a
                  declarative policy language to specify a set of
                  constraints on accesses to resources. A set of code
                  transformation tools enforces these constraints on
                  mobile programs by integrating the access constraint
                  checking code directly into the mobile program and
                  resource definitions. Because our approach does not
                  require resources to make explicit calls to a
                  reference monitor, it does not depend upon a
                  specific runtime system implementation.},

                  terms of a number of language design choices
                  concerning the relationship between objects and obc.
                  We identify requirements for software reuse and,
                  with the help of an example that illustrates several
                  of these requirements, explore the design space in

                  developing and configuring reusable components. A
                  key problem is the synchronization of components:
                  components must be designed to work in different

                  synchronization requirements. In this paper we

                  object-oriented programming is to exploit the
                  software reuse potential of object-oriented features
                  in the development of concurrent systems. Early
                  attempts to introduce concurrency to object-oriented
                  languages uncovered interferences between
                  object-oriented and concurrency features that
                  limited the extent to which the benefits of
                  objectoriented programming could be realized for
                  developing concurrent systems. This has fostered
                  considerable research into languages and approaches
                  aiming at a graceful integration of object-oriented
                  and concurrent programming. We will examine the
                  issues underlying concurrent object-oriented
                  programming, examine and compare how different
                  approaches for language design address these issues.

                  exhaustive survey of concurrent object-oriented
                  languages, we provide a broad coverage of the

	Abstract = {The coordination among a set of concurrent objects
                  is commonly expressed through language specific
                  synchronization mechanisms in the objects'
                  implementation. Unfortunately, such an approach
                  makes it difficult to reuse these objects in
                  applications with different coordination patterns.
                  Moreover, the algorithms used for object
                  coordination are inextricably linked to the original
                  object implementation and cannot themselves be
                  easily reused for the coordination of objects with
                  different implementations. In this paper, we propose
                  a model that promotes the reuse of both objects and
                  coordination patterns. The model allows objects to
                  synchronize their execution with events occurring in
                  other objects (e.g. state changes and method
                  invocations) in a way that is compatible with local
                  object synchronization constraints and respects
                  encapsulation. The model also supports the use of
                  class inheritance while avoiding most of the
                  problems of combining inheritance with
                  synchronization. Finally, we consider the use of the
                  model in the area of distributed multimedia
                  applications. In this area active objects
                  encapsulate media processing activities while a
                  synchronous language is used to specify their
                  temporal coordination.},

                  that manipulate much persistent data and interact
                  with the user through a vast and complex user
                  interface. In particular applications written for
                  the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) are
                  composed using various technologies such as
                  Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) or Java Server Pages
                  (JSP) that in turn rely on languages other than
                  Java, such as XML or SQL. In this heterogeneous
                  context applying existing reverse engineering and
                  quality assurance techniques developed for
                  object-oriented systems is not enough. Because those
                  techniques have been created to measure quality or
                  provide information about one aspect of J2EE
                  applications, they cannot properly measure the
                  quality of the entire system. We intend to devise
                  techniques and metrics to measure quality in J2EE
                  applications considering all their aspects and to
                  aid their evolution. Using software visualization we
                  also intend to inspect to structure of J2EE
                  applications and all other aspects that can be
                  investigate through this technique. In order to do
                  that we also need to create a unified meta-model
                  including all elements composing a J2EE

	Abstract = {Java Enterprise Applications (JEAs) are complex
                  systems composed using various technologies that in
                  turn rely on languages other than Java, such as XML
                  or SQL. Given the complexity of these applications,
                  the need to reverse engineer them in order to
                  support further development becomes critical. In
                  this paper we show how it is possible to split a
                  system into layers and how is possible to interpret
                  the distance between application elements in order
                  to support the refactoring of JEAs. The purpose of
                  this paper is to explore ways to provide suggestions
                  about the refactoring operations to perform on the
                  code by evaluating the distance between layers and
                  elements belonging those layers. We split JEAs into
                  layers by considering the kinds and the purposes of
                  the elements composing the application. We measure
                  distance between elements by using the notion of the
                  shortest path in a graph. Also we present how to
                  enrich the interpretation of the distance value with
                  enterprise pattern detection in order to refine the
                  suggestion about modifications to perform on the

	Abstract = {Java Enterprise Applications (JEAs) are large
                  systems that integrate multiple technologies and
                  programming languages. Transactions in JEAs simplify
                  the development of code that deals with failure
                  recovery and multi-user coordination by guaranteeing
                  atomicity of sets of operations. The heterogeneous
                  nature of JEAs, however, can obfuscate conceptual
                  errors in the application code, and in particular
                  can hide incorrect declarations of transaction
                  scope. In this paper we present a technique to
                  expose and analyze the application transaction scope
                  in JEAs by merging and analyzing information from
                  multiple sources. We also present several novel
                  visualizations that aid in the analysis of
                  transaction scope by highlighting anomalies in the
                  specification of transactions and violations of
                  architectural constraints. We have validated our
                  approach on two versions of a large commercial case

                  developer in the design of applications based on
                  reusable objects. Design information is associated
                  with each class to guide the developer in building
                  applications, addressing separately the various
                  design aspects. The refinement process during the
                  construction of a given application and the problem
                  of inserting the necessary design support
                  information in a repository are discussed.},

                  affinity between objects; that is, a relationship
                  with an associated intensity. The user is presented
                  with a two dimensional map that provides a view of
                  the hypermedia environment where objects lying close
                  together have a greater affinity than those lying
                  further apart. The system provides different views
                  by allowing modification of the underlying measure
                  of affinity. The system is also able to track
                  dynamically the evolution of the objects'
                  relationships. Based on the affinity concept, we
                  develop new dynamic presentation techniques that do
                  not depend on the explicit display of links between
                  the nodes of the graph. The dynamic layout algorithm
                  that we present at the end of the paper is based on
                  these techniques and it allows for the display of
                  rapidly changing relationships between objects.},

	Abstract = {Reusability is widely believed to be a key to
                  improving software development productivity.
                  However, in practice, effective reuse is more an
                  achievement of good development environments than a
                  strategy for software development. It seems natural
                  that a reduction of the effort needed for reuse
                  should have a positive impact on reuse. Among the
                  various lines of attack that may lead to a reduction
                  of the reuse effort, we address the problem of
                  finding and understanding reusable functionality in
                  an object-oriented software environment. This paper
                  presents the Affinity Browser, a selection and
                  exploration tool based on the notion of affinity
                  between objects. The user is presented with a two
                  dimensional display where the objects are displayed
                  in such a way that their relative positions convey
                  their affinity i.e., objects lying closer together
                  are more strongly related than objects lying farther
                  apart. The browser provides for different views of
                  the relationships among objects. Each view is based
                  on a different measure of affinity and thus portrays
                  a different relationship. We discuss the rationale
                  behind the Affinity Browser tool and discuss the way
                  users can take advantage of it to understand the
                  functionality provided by a set of classes. The
                  Affinity Browser's ability to help understanding
                  relationships between objects will be illustrated by
                  two examples of view construction.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to software
                  construction that relies on the connection of
                  reusable components. The approach is derived from
                  the observation that a design framework plays a
                  central role in the reuse process in the sense that
                  both the design of applications and the design of
                  reusable components must follow the same design
                  discipline. The interaction between components is
                  mediated by an object: the gluon. Gluons are
                  attached to reusable components and they represent
                  the rights to a service provided by the component.
                  Gluons can be seen as coupons: once detached they
                  grant a service that can be exchanged among objects.
                  Gluons can also encapsulate an activity performed by
                  a set of cooperating components. With this approach,
                  the construction of applications can be seen as a
                  market where components that ask for services can
                  purchase rights from other components that offer
                  them.},

                  radars as a flexible data representation technique
                  for financial information. The concept of
                  information radar takes inspiration on traditional
                  oscilloscopes and radars. Information radars are 2D
                  visualization tools that display multiple
                  superimposed translucent data representation layers.
                  Each representation layer being translucent allows
                  the layers that lay behind it to be seen. The radar
                  provides multiple interaction modes so that the user
                  can interact with the various layers either to
                  modify representations, to explore data
                  relationships, or to access other tools. Information
                  radars rely on fast a-channel operations to
                  visualize multiple representation layers

                  is driven by a fuzzy controller to which users can

                  containment graphs, and diverse patterns of dynamic
                  interaction all contribute to difficulties in
                  understanding, reusing, debugging, and tuning large
                  object-oriented systems. These difficulties may have
                  a significant impact on the usefulness of such
                  systems. Tools that help in understanding the
                  contents and behaviour of an object-oriented
                  environment should play a major role in reducing
                  such difficulties. Such tools allow for the
                  exploration of different aspects of a software
                  environment such as inheritance structures, part-of
                  relationships, etc. However, object-oriented systems
                  differ in many respects from traditional database
                  systems, and in particular, conventional querying
                  mechanisms used in databases show poor performance
                  when used for the exploration of objectoriented
                  environments. This chapter defines the requirements
                  for effective exploration mechanisms in the realm of
                  object-oriented environments. We propose an approach
                  to browsing based on the notion of affinity that
                  satisfies such requirements. Our tool, the affinity
                  browser, provides a visual representation of object
                  relationships presented in terms of affinity.
                  Objects that appear closer in the visual
                  representation are more strongly related than
                  objects lying farther apart. So, the intensity of a
                  relationship is translated into distance in the
                  visual representation that provides the support for
                  user navigation. We provide many examples of metrics
                  defined over the objects of an environment to
                  illustrate how object relationships can be
                  translated in terms of affinity so that they can be
                  used for the exploration of an environment.},

                  specify the patterns of interaction among software
                  components so that they can be assembled to perform
                  tasks in a cooperative way. Such cooperative
                  assembly requires that components obey rules
                  ensuring their interaction compatibility. The choice
                  of a specific approach to specifying rules depends
                  on various criteria such as the kind of target
                  environment, the nature of the software components
                  or the kind of programming language. This chapter
                  reviews major efforts to develop and promote
                  standards that address this issue. We present our
                  own approach to the construction of a development
                  framework for software applications that make use of
                  real-time financial information. For this domain,
                  the two main requirements are (1) to facilitate the
                  integration of new components into an existing
                  system, and (2) to allow for the run-time
                  composition of software components.The goal of the
                  development framework is to provide dynamic
                  interconnection capabilities. The basic idea is to
                  standardize and reuse interaction protocols that are
                  encapsulated inside special objects called gluons.
                  These objects mediate the cooperation of software
                  components. We discuss the advantages of the
                  approach, and provide examples of how gluons are

	Abstract = {Successful software systems cope with complexity by
                  organizing classes into packages. However, a
                  particular organization may be neither
                  straightforward nor obvious for a given developer.
                  As a consequence, classes can be misplaced, leading
                  to duplicated code and ripple effects with minor
                  changes effecting multiple packages. We claim that
                  contextual information is the key to rearchitecture
                  a system. Exploiting contextual information, we
                  propose a technique to detect misplaced classes by
                  analyzing how client packages access the classes of
                  a given provider package. We define locality as a
                  measure of the degree to which classes reused by
                  common clients appear in the same package. We then
                  use locality to guide a simulated annealing
                  algorithm to obtain optimal placements of classes in
                  packages. The result is the identification of
                  classes that are candidates for relocation. We apply
                  the technique to three applications and validate the
                  usefulness of our approach via developer
                  interviews.},

	Abstract = {Complex systems are decomposed into cohesive
                  packages with the goal of limiting the scope of
                  changes: if our packages are cohesive, we hope that
                  changes will be limited to the packages responsible
                  for the features we are changing, or at worst the
                  packages that are immediate clients of those
                  features. But how should we measure cohesion?
                  Traditional cohesion metrics focus on the explicit
                  dependencies and interactions between the classes
                  within the package under study. A package, however,
                  may be conceptually cohesive even though its classes
                  exhibit no explicit dependencies. We propose a group
                  of contextual metrics that assess the cohesion of a
                  package based on the degree to which its classes are
                  used together by common clients. We apply these
                  metrics to various case studies, and contrast the
                  degree of cohesion detected with that of traditional
                  cohesion metrics. In particular, we note that
                  object-oriented frameworks may appear not to be
                  cohesive with traditional metrics, whereas our
                  contextual metrics expose the implicit cohesion that
                  results from the framework's clients.},

	Abstract = {Over the last thirty years designers have tried to
                  cope with software complexity by organizing system
                  entities into modules, i.e. groups of entities.
                  However, the creation and organization of modules is
                  not straightforward. The criterion with which these
                  modules are built impacts in the maintainability and
                  development of the system. Designers have different
                  interests and personal views of the same system,
                  views that are difficult to communicate and to
                  extract from the code. Poor understanding of this
                  organization increases the complexity of the system
                  e.g. by favoring the addition of duplication and of
                  unexpected rippling effects. This, in turn, lowers
                  the flexibility of the system to changing
                  requirements and leads to a sharp increase in their
                  maintenance cost. To overcome these problems, we
                  present a methodology to manage the locality in
                  object-oriented systems. We develop a model that
                  exploits the contextual information, i.e. the way
                  objects are used by their clients, to understand and
                  improve the organization of classes in the system.
                  With our model we take full advantage of the
                  contextual information of modules to evaluate their
                  cohesion, find misplaced classes, detect hot spots
                  and find the different views that its clients have.
                  In our experimental validation we apply the
                  contextual information to understand, maintain and
                  describe systems. Our methodology is applied
                  successively together with metrics, visualization
                  techniques, and an optimization method named
                  simulated annealing to reverse-engineer
                  object-oriented systems. All in all, we provide a
                  methodology to understand and improve the
                  modularization of object-oriented systems, in an
                  effort towards simplicity.},

@techreport{Prev90a,
	Abstract = {Hypertext systems have gained acceptance in a wide
                  range of application domains (e.g. CASE, systems
                  design, outline processors etc.). However, in order
                  to function effectively in these domains, hypertext
                  systems must support versioning. In this paper we
                  will examine the issues involved in providing
                  versioning facilities that not only support but
                  enhance the special features provided by hypertext.
                  We analyse the requirements that should be satisfied
                  by a versioning system and we examine how existing
                  hypertext systems cope with these requirements. We
                  then describe a set of mechanisms that are powerful
                  enough to comply with our requirements. Finally, we
                  present a demonstration system that will be used to
                  evaluate the effectiveness of our versioning
                  mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Darwin is a programming system for the development
                  of distributed and parallel programs. Darwin
                  programs consist of three parts. Firstly, there is a
                  configuration part which provides a hierarchical
                  structure of components with dynamic binding.
                  Secondly, there is the actual communication part
                  which provides the interaction and synchronisation
                  required by the system. Finally, there is the
                  computation part providing the component programs
                  written in C++. The subdivision of concurrent
                  programs into the three separate parts of
                  organisation, communication and computation leads to
                  programs that are easy to specify, compile and
                  execute. In order to specify precisely the behaviour
                  of Darwin programs, we translate the organisation
                  and communication into the Pi-calculus, a formalism
                  for modelling concurrent processes. The Pi-calculus
                  semantics enables us to deduce behavioural
                  properties of Darwin programs.},

	Abstract = {There is a currently considerable interest in
                  advanced transaction processing. Most proposals
                  weaken serializability. The concurrency of
                  transactions executing on shared objects can be
                  enhanced with the use of semantic information about
                  operations type or through user defined semantics
                  called transaction semantic. This paper attempts to
                  unify the two approaches; we present an extended
                  model which exploits both transaction and object
                  semantics to increase concurrency. The approach we
                  adopt is similar to the one used in
                  [Lynch83,Molina83,FO89]. However, our mechanism for
                  specifying allowable interleavings is based on
                  predicate over step types and synchronization
                  operators. It supports concurrent execution of steps
                  and synchronization amongst them. We will integrate
                  this distributed concurrency control policy into a
                  high level language to hide low-level details such
                  as locks, timestamps management and concurrent
                  activities synchronization inside the implementation
                  of the language constructs. We use ANSA
                  computational language DPL (Distributed Programming
                  Language) as a basic language construct. We propose
                  a few DPL extensions to support our model. This
                  model is suitable to express a wide range of
                  synchronization constraints between concurrent
                  activities.},

	Abstract = {With the success of agile methodologies, Testing has
                  become a common and important activity in the
                  development of software projects. Large and auto-
                  mated test-suites ensure that the system is behaving
                  as expected. Moreover, tests also offer a live
                  documentation for the code and can be used to under-
                  stand foreign code. However, as the system evolves,
                  tests need to evolve as well to keep up with the
                  system, and as the test suite grows larger, the
                  effort invested into maintaining tests becomes a
                  significant activity. In this context, the quality
                  of tests becomes an important issue, as developers
                  need to assess and understand the tests they have to
                  maintain. While testing have grown to be popular and
                  well supported by today's IDEs, methodologies and
                  tools trying to assess the quality of tests are
                  still poorly or not at all integrated into the
                  testing process. Most important, there has been no
                  attempts yet to concretely measure the quality of a
                  test by detecting design flaws of the test code, so
                  called Test Smells. We contribute to the research of
                  testing methodologies by measuring and assessing the
                  quality of tests. In particular we analyze Test
                  Smells and define a set of criteria to determine
                  test quality. We evaluate our results in a large
                  case-study and present TestLint, an approach to
                  automatically detect Test Smells. We provide a
                  bundle of tools that tightly integrate source-code
                  development, automated testing and quality

	Abstract = {Developing applications that end users can customize
                  is a challenge, since end users are domain experts
                  but still have concrete requirements. In this master
                  thesis we present how we used a meta-driven approach
                  to support the end user customization of Web
                  applications. We present Magritte, a recursive
                  meta-data meta-model integrated into the Smalltalk
                  reflective meta-model. The adaptive model of
                  Magritte enables to not only describe existing
                  classes but also let end users build their own
                  meta-models on the fly. Further on we describe how
                  meta-interpreters automatically build views,
                  reports, validating editors and persistency
                  mechanisms. As a complete example of how we applied
                  a meta-model to a Web application we present Pier,
                  the second version of a fully object-oriented
                  implementation of a content management system and
                  Wiki engine. Pier is implemented with objects from
                  the top to the bottom and is designed to be
                  customizable to accommodate new needs. The
                  integration of a powerful meta-description layer
                  makes it a breeze to extend the running system with
                  new functionality without having to patch the core
                  engine. We describe the lessons learned from using
                  the Magritte meta-model to build applications. Both

                  and is therefore notoriously difficult to use. Even
                  though some implementations provide high-level
                  constructs, these add complexity and potentially
                  hard-to-detect bugs to the application.
                  Transactional memory is an attractive mechanism that
                  does not have the drawbacks of locks, however the
                  underlying implementation is often difficult to
                  integrate into an existing language. In this paper
                  we show how we have introduced transactional
                  semantics in Smalltalk by using the reflective
                  facilities of the language. Our approach is based on
                  method annotations, incremental parse tree

	Abstract = {Concurrency control is mostly based on locks and is
                  therefore notoriously difficult to use. Even though
                  some programming languages provide high-level
                  constructs, these add complexity and potentially
                  hard-to-detect bugs to the application.
                  Transactional memory is an attractive mechanism that
                  does not have the drawbacks of locks, however the
                  underlying implementation is often difficult to
                  integrate into an existing language. In this paper
                  we show how we have introduced transactional
                  semantics into Smalltalk by using the reflective
                  facilities of the language. Our approach is based on
                  method annotations, incremental parse tree
                  transformations and an optimistic commit protocol.
                  The implementation does not depend on modifications
                  to the virtual machine and therefore can be changed
                  at the language level. We report on a practical case
                  study, benchmarks and further and on-going work.},

	Abstract = {Integration of multiple languages into each other
                  and into an existing development environment is a
                  difficult task. As a consequence, developers often
                  end up using only internal DSLs that strictly rely
                  on the constraints imposed by the host language.
                  Infrastructures do exist to mix languages, but they
                  often do it at the price of losing the development
                  tools of the host language. Instead of inventing a
                  completely new infrastructure, our solution is to
                  integrate new languages deeply into the existing
                  host environment and reuse the infrastructure
                  offered by it. In this paper we show why Smalltalk
                  is the best practical choice for such a host

	Abstract = {Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are increasingly
                  used as embedded languages within general-purpose
                  host languages. DSLs provide a compact, dedicated
                  syntax for specifying parts of an application
                  related to specialized domains. Unfortunately, such
                  language extensions typically do not integrate well
                  with the development tools of the host language.
                  Editors, compilers and debuggers are either unaware
                  of the extensions, or must be adapted at a
                  non-trivial cost. We present a novel approach to
                  embed DSLs into an existing host language by
                  leveraging the underlying representation of the host
                  language used by these tools. Helvetia is an
                  extensible system that intercepts the compilation
                  pipeline of the Smalltalk host language to
                  seamlessly integrate language extensions. We
                  validate our approach by case studies that
                  demonstrate three fundamentally different ways to
                  extend or adapt the host language syntax and
                  semantics.},

                  and maintainability of the code base. At the same
                  time, the synchronization defined statically in the
                  code is not capable of adapting to different runtime

                  control which strictly separates the functional code
                  from the synchronization requirements to be used and
                  which adapts objects to be synchronized dynamically
                  to their environment. First-class synchronization
                  specifications express safety requirements, and a
                  dynamic synchronization system dynamically adapts
                  objects to different runtime situations. We present

                  reflect on its structure and its behavior.
                  Object-oriented languages introduced reflection to
                  deal with this issue, however, no reflective
                  approach up to now has tried to provide a unified

                  Albedo is a model of fined-grained unanticipated

	                  software system, developers pose detailed questions about the
	                  runtime behavior of the system. Source code views offer strictly
	                  limited insights, so developers often turn to tools like debuggers
	                  to inspect and interact with the running system. Unfortunately,
	                  traditional debuggers focus on the runtime stack as the key
	                  abstraction to support debugging operations, though the questions
	                  developers pose often have more to do with objects and their
	                  interactions.
	                  We propose object-centric debugging as an alternative approach
	                  to interacting with a running software system. We show how, by
	                  focusing on objects as the key abstraction, natural debugging
	                  operations can be defined to answer developer questions related
	                  to runtime behavior. We present a running prototype of an
	                  object-centric debugger, and demonstrate, with the help of a series
	                  of examples, how object-centric debugging offers more effective
	                  support for many typical developer tasks than a traditional

	Abstract = {The reality of software development is such that
                  engineers must often perform maintenance tasks with
                  missing or out-of-date documentation and without the
                  support of the original developers. To understand
                  the software as it is now, engineers use reverse
                  engineering tools to recover information from the
                  code itself. Most such tools analyze only static
                  information about the system and so provide
                  engineers with structural, rather than behavioral
                  models. It is, however, critical to understand the
                  behavioral aspect of the software system in order to
                  carry out certain maintenance tasks. To better
                  understand program behavior engineers turn to tools
                  which use dynamic information collected during
                  program execution. Such tools typically display all
                  the dynamic information at very fine granularity,
                  making it difficult to extract manageable models of
                  behavior. They then rely on visualization and
                  navigation techniques to help the engineer locate
                  information relevant to the change task. In this
                  dissertation we propose an approach to recovering
                  behavioral models from object-oriented software
                  which is based on perspectives. Our approach enables
                  an engineer to declaratively define perspectives
                  through which the dynamic information can be viewed.
                  It supports an iterative recovery process in which
                  successive views of the software system help the
                  engineer to answer questions related to the
                  maintenance task to be performed. We claim that such
                  an approach can overcome the difficulties of
                  recovering succinct and focused views of
                  object-oriented software from dynamic information. A
                  perspective is a model of the kind of information
                  that an engineer is interested in. Our approach
                  supports the construction of principally two kinds
                  of such models: component-connector models and
                  collaboration models. We first identify a meta-model
                  for describing object-oriented software and its
                  execution, then develop a simple declarative way to
                  express perspectives in terms of this meta-model:
                  component-connector perspectives express a range of
                  static groupings and dynamic relations;
                  collaboration perspectives abstract from execution
                  sequences to class collaborations. Using case
                  studies we demonstrate the validity of our approach
                  by showing how perspectives are used in an iterative
                  process to recover both high-level and low-level
                  succinct behavioral views.},

                  time gives us valuable information. It suggests
                  which parts are likely to remain stable and which
                  'problem' aspects are likely to change, and it gives
                  us insight into some of the design choices made. In
                  this paper we show how recovered views of succesive

	Abstract = {Duplicated code can have a severe, negative impact
                  on the maintainability of large software systems.
                  Techniques for detecting duplicated code exist but
                  they rely mostly on parsers, technology that is
                  often fragile in the face of different languages and
                  dialects. In this paper we show that a lightweight
                  approach based on simple string-matching can be
                  effectively used to detect a significant amount of
                  code duplication. The approach scales well, and can
                  be easily adapted to different languages and
                  contexts. We validate our approach by applying it to
                  a number of industrial and open source case studies,
                  involving five different implementation languages
                  and ranging from 256KB to 13MB of source code.
                  Finally, we compare our approach to a more
                  sophisticated one employing parameterized matching,
                  and demonstrate that little if anything is gained by
                  adopting a more heavyweight approach.},

	Abstract = {Duplication is detected by comparing features of
                  source fragments. The main problem for the detection
                  is that source code is rarely copied exactly. The
                  detection process must be able to ignore the
                  superficial differences and to concentrate on
                  fundamental similarities in order to find relevant
                  duplication. While the high level information
                  yielded by syntactic and semantic code analysis can
                  be put to effective use, the drawbacks of these deep
                  analysis techniques are most importantly the reduced
                  adaptability to different programming languages.
                  Because duplication is an ubiquitous problem,
                  however, support for duplication detection and
                  management is needed for every programming language
                  in use. In this thesis we investigate how the
                  premises of simplicity and adaptability influence
                  all phases of the clone detection process. We
                  analyze how line-based string matching as basic
                  feature comparison technique can be augmented by
                  minimal parsing to improve detection sensitivity. We
                  investigate which code normalization techniques
                  remove the superficial differences and reveal the
                  similarities. We show how clone candidates are
                  retrieved from the results of the basic comparison.
                  We propose measures to select the relevant clones
                  from the set of all retrieved candidates. We finally
                  develop a collection of quantitative visualizations
                  that enable the assessment of the copied code in the
                  context of the entire system. We experimentally
                  validate the proposed code normalization technique
                  in terms of precision and recall, show how the
                  proposed relevancy measures improve on simple size
                  metrics, and discuss scalability issues. We also
                  validate the line-based granularity, and perform a
                  comparison of our technique with related string
                  matching detectors.},

                  requirements often change during the product
                  development life cycle to meet shifting business
                  demands, creating endless headaches for development
                  teams. These authors from AG Communications Systems
                  discuss their experience in implementing the Scrum
                  software development process to address these
                  concerns. In experimenting with the Scrum software
                  development process, they have found that small
                  teams can be flexible and adaptable in defining and
                  applying an appropriate variant of Scrum.},

                  environment (IDE) extensions which assist developers

                  specific aspects of the general activity of
                  programming, their impact is hard to assess. In
                  previous work, we used with success an evaluation
                  strategy using automated benchmarks to automatically
                  and precisely evaluate several recommender systems,
                  based on recording and replaying developer
                  interactions. In this paper, we highlight the
                  challenges we expect to encounter while applying
                  this approach to other recommender systems.},

                  the internet. In today's business, web-applications
                  become more and more complex but they still need to
                  be fast developed, flexible for changes and easy to
                  maintain --- conventional techniques often lack
                  these properties. High-level, cleanly layered
                  solutions open promising possibilities to overcome
                  these difficulties. This paper presents a
                  lightweight, object-oriented, metadata-driven
                  approach to build better engineered and easier
                  evolvable and maintainable web-applications.},

	Abstract = {Reflection is an important tool to extend and modify
                  the semantics or runtime of applications. However,
                  lot of approaches to support reflection are based on
                  up-front fully reflective or load-time based
                  reflection mechanisms. Using these approaches, it is
                  not possible to apply reflective techniques on
                  running systems without stopping them, unless the
                  system is fully reflection which is very costly.
                  Because many applications and systems exist that
                  cannot be halted and stopped but have to be always
                  on and running, such as web applications, real-time
                  systems or mobile systems, the ability to apply
                  reflective features at runtime is a crucial and
                  important property. Our solution to achieve this
                  possibility is unanticipated reflection. With
                  unanticipated reflection, we can design the MOP
                  required for the problem we want to solve, introduce
                  it in the language, activate the reflective
                  mechanisms and possibly remove them once they are
                  not necessary anymore at runtime, without halting
                  the system or the application in which we want to
                  apply and use the reflective mechanisms.},

                  an object-oriented system in terms of packages,
                  classes and methods. From a structural perspective
                  it is difficult to gain an understanding of how
                  source entities participate in a system's features
                  at runtime. In this paper we evaluate the usefulness
                  of offering an alternative feature-centric
                  perspective of a software system when performing
                  maintenance activities. We present a feature-centric
                  environment combining interactive visual

                  browser displaying only the classes and methods

                  validate the usefulness of our feature-centric view,
                  we conducted a controlled empirical experiment where

                  These mechanisms are usually based purely on a
                  system's static source code. The static perspective,
                  however, is not enough to understand an
                  object-oriented program's behavior, in particular if

                  enhance IDEs with a program's runtime information

                  program comprehension through precise navigation and

                  and amount of runtime data to gather about a system
                  under development, dynamically and on demand, we
                  adopt a technique known as partial behavioral

                  Development environments typically provide static
                  views of the source code (e.g., classes and
                  methods), but do not explicitly represent dynamic

                  challenging.To address this we have developed
                  several techniques to represent dynamic behavior at
                  various levels of granularity directly in the IDE.
                  In this paper we outline these various techniques

                  development environments such as Eclipse,

                  perspective neglects any information about runtime
                  behavior. However, object-oriented programs heavily

                  dynamic information in the Eclipse IDE with the goal of better
                  supporting typical software maintenance activities.
                  By means of a controlled experiment with 30 professional
                  developers we show that for typical software maintenance tasks
                  integrating dynamic information into the Eclipse IDE yields a
                  significant 17.5\% decrease of time spent while significantly
                  increasing the correctness of the solutions by 33.5\%.
                  We also provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of
                  our approach.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented language features such as
                  inheritance, abstract types, late-binding, or
                  polymorphism lead to distributed and scattered code,
                  rendering a software system hard to understand and
                  maintain. The integrated development environment
                  (IDE), the primary tool used by developers to
                  maintain software systems, usually purely operates
                  on static source code and does not reveal dynamic
                  relationships between distributed source artifacts,
                  which makes it difficult for developers to
                  understand and navigate software systems. Another
                  shortcoming of today's IDEs is the large amount of
                  information with which they typically overwhelm
                  developers. Large software systems encompass several
                  thousand source artifacts such as classes and
                  methods. These static artifacts are presented by
                  IDEs in views such as trees or source editors. To
                  gain an understanding of a system, developers have
                  to open many such views, which leads to a workspace
                  cluttered with different windows or tabs. Navigating
                  through the code or maintaining a working context is
                  thus difficult for developers working on large
                  software systems. In this dissertation we address
                  the question how to augment IDEs with dynamic
                  information to better navigate scattered code while
                  at the same time not overwhelming developers with
                  even more information in the IDE views. We claim
                  that by first reducing the amount of information
                  developers have to deal with, we are subsequently
                  able to embed dynamic information in the familiar
                  source perspectives of IDEs to better comprehend and
                  navigate large software spaces. We propose means to
                  reduce or mitigate the information by highlighting
                  relevant source elements, by explicitly representing
                  working context, and by automatically housekeeping
                  the workspace in the IDE. We then improve navigation
                  of scattered code by explicitly representing dynamic
                  collaboration and software features in the static
                  source perspectives of IDEs. We validate our claim
                  by conducting empirical experiments with developers
                  and by analyzing recorded development sessions.},

                  Quellsprache in eine Zielsprache. Um Programme in
                  einer beliebigen Umgebung ausf\"uhren zu k\"onnen,
                  muss eine plattformunabh\"angige Zielsprache gesucht
                  werden. Die Plattformunabh\"angigkeit wird dadurch
                  erreicht, dass die Programme nicht auf einer
                  konkreten, sondern auf einer virtuellen Maschine
                  ausgef\"uhrt werden, die als Schnittstelle zwischen
                  compiliertem Code und Plattform dient. Die virtuelle
                  Maschine von Java ("JVM") verarbeitet nicht nur
                  Java, sondern alle Programme, die in einem genau
                  spezifizierten Format dargestellt werden. Beim
                  Compilerbau trennt eine Zwischensprache die Analyse
                  des Quellprogrammes von der Synthese zum
                  Zielprogramm; man kann die beiden Teile unabh\"angig
                  voneinander behandeln. Durch die Verwendung einer
                  Zwischensprache muss nicht jede Quellsprache einzeln
                  in eine bestimmte Zielsprache \"ubersetzt werden,
                  sondern die verschiedenen Analyse-Teile, die
                  Compilerfrontends der Quellsprachen, arbeiten mit
                  einem einzigen Synthese-Teil, dem Compilerbackend
                  f\"ur die Zielsprache zusammen. In dieser
                  Diplomarbeit wird ein Compilerframework aufgebaut,
                  das dank der Zielmaschine JVM plattformunabh\"angig
                  ist, und eine Zwischensprache verwendet, die die
                  Eigenschaften verschiedenartigster Sprachen umfasst.
                  Mittels einer Analyse von Programmiersprachen des
                  imperativen, des objektorientierten, des
                  funktionalen und des logischen Paradigmas werden die
                  Anforderungen an diese generelle Zwischensprache
                  aufgestellt. F\"ur jedes Paradigma wird die
                  Grammatik einer Beispielsprache definiert und ein
                  Parser konstruiert. Diese Parser \"ubersetzen
                  Programme ihrer Quellsprachen in die generelle

                  generiert aus der generellen Zwischensprache
                  JVM-Code. Der Compiler wird mit Hilfe eines
                  Frameworks konstruiert, indem die Zwischensprache
                  und die Codegenerierung in Klassen mit m\"oglichst

                  basis for the query language of a temporal,
                  object-oriented data model. Our algebra is a
                  super-set of the relational algebra in that it
                  provides support for manipulating temporal objects,
                  temporal types, type hierarchies and class lattices,
                  multiple time-lines, and correction sequences in
                  addition to supporting the five relational algebra
                  operators. Graphs are used as the visual
                  representations of both the schema and the object
                  instances. The algebra provides constructs to modify
                  and manipulate the schema graph and its extension,
                  the object graph. The algebra operates on a
                  collection or collections of objects and returns a
                  collection of objects. This algebra is a first step
                  in providing a formal foundation for query
                  processing and optimizing in a temporal,

                  reuse in object-oriented programming, we must better
                  understand the process involved in software reuse.
                  Our work addresses this need, analyzing four
                  experienced Smalltalk programmers as they enhanced
                  applications by reusing new classes. These were
                  {\itactive} programmers: rather than suspending
                  programming activity to reflect on how to use the
                  new components, they began work immediately
                  recruiting code from example usage contexts and
                  relying heavily on the system debugger to guide them
                  in applying the borrowed context. We discuss the

	Abstract = {Using Smalltalk-80, programmers can produce
                  prototypes much faster than with C or Pascal. What
                  techniques do Smalltalk-80 programmers use to
                  produce these prototypes? What is special about
                  Smalltalk-80 that enables them to uses these
                  techniques? Can these techniques be used with
                  conventional languages such as C? In an attempt to
                  answer these questions we interviewed experienced
                  Smalltalk programmers and asked how they approach
                  programming in Smalltalk. Such introspective
                  interviews that are conducted after completion of a
                  project are known to be somewhat unreliable, but not
                  enough is known to use any other methodology. What
                  follows is a summary of the interviews, followed by
                  an explanation of the results. Finally we discuss
                  some of the weaknesses of Smalltalk and some
                  possible solutions.},

                  model, which captures the intuitions which underlie
                  the design of the United Functions and Objects
                  programming language. The model has two aspects,
                  which turn out to be a traditional dataflow model
                  and an actor-like model, with a very simple
                  interface between the two. Certain aspects of the
                  model, particularly strictness, maximum parallelism,
                  lack of suspension, and the implications of
                  introducing stateful objects, are stressed. The
                  model is embodied in a textual intermediate format,

	Abstract = {The role of explicit state in parallel programming
                  is a problematic one, especially from the functional
                  programming perspective. In this paper we discuss
                  why we believe explicit state is necessary for
                  general-purpose parallel programming, what features
                  we have adopted to support it, and (tentatively)
                  when it is appropriate to use stateful objects
                  rather than a purely functional representation. To
                  provide some context for the when discussion, we
                  also review some of the pure functional features of
                  UFO, concentrating on those aspects of the language
                  which have evolved since the original version.
                  Finally, we look at how stateful objects can be
                  implemented efficiently. This has many aspects; we
                  focus on one, namely analysis to control thread
                  sizes, and present some preliminary results in this

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a formalism for reasoning about
                  distributed object-oriented computations. The
                  formalism is an extension of Milner's CCS with the
                  notion of local time. It allows to describe and
                  analyze both locally temporal and behavioral
                  properties of distributed objects and interactions
                  among them. We introduce timed bisimulations with
                  respect to local time. These bisimulations equate
                  distributed objects if and only if their behaviors
                  are completely matched and their timings are within
                  a given bound. The bisimulations provide a method to
                  verify distributed objects with temporal
                  uncertainties and real-time objects with non-strict
                  time constraints.},

@mastersthesis{Scha01a,
	Abstract = {Inter-language bridging is an important issue of
                  scripting language design and implementation. Most
                  of the popular languages such as Python, Perl, Tcl,
                  and Ruby use a bridging approach based on wrappers
                  that are written in the external language (usually
                  C/C++) and serve as a glue layer between the
                  languages. This allows a wide flexibility in
                  defining the glue abstractions, but it requires the
                  user to specify them on the level of the
                  implementation language, and it therefore impairs
                  the higher-level scripting process. In contrast, the
                  first implementations of JPiccola, a scripting and
                  composition language implemented in {Java}, use a
                  generic bridging strategy based on information
                  provided by {Java}'s runtime introspection
                  facilities. This strategy makes accessing of
                  external objects more lightweight, but it does not
                  provide the necessary means of abstraction and leads
                  to a very tight coupling between the two language
                  levels. In this thesis, we present a new bridging
                  strategy for Piccola that combines the advantages of
                  the two approaches. We minimize the bridging
                  functionality that is hardcoded in the virtual
                  machine by making it a meta-aspect of the language
                  Piccola. This allows the programmer to use the
                  unrestricted expressive power of the scripting
                  language to specify the glue abstractions at a
                  higher level and adapt them dynamically. As a second
                  contribution, we present a lazy evaluation technique
                  that significantly reduces the performance overhead
                  introduced by the meta-level bridging layer. In
                  order to apply this lazy evaluation technique to
                  Piccola services in general, we develop a partial
                  evaluation algorithm that separates the side effects
                  of a service and turns the individual expressions
                  into closures. Finally, we give an overview of
                  SPiccola, a Squeak-based Piccola implementation with
                  thread-aware debugging tools.},

	Abstract = {Wrapping external components by scripts can be a
                  performance bottleneck if inter-language bridging is
                  frequent. Piccola is a pure composition language
                  that wraps components according to a specific
                  composition style. This wrapping must be efficient,
                  since even arithmetic operations are done by
                  external components. In this paper we present how to
                  use partial evaluation to overcome much of the
                  overhead associated with the wrapping. It turns out
                  that Piccola scripts can be highly optimized since
                  form expression exhibit the right kind of
                  information to separate side effects from services

	Abstract = {Scripting and composition languages offer high-level
                  mechanisms to combine and compose services provided
                  by a lower-level host programming language.
                  Inter-language bridging mechanisms are therefore
                  needed to map host language entities and services to
                  abstractions of the scripting language, and vice
                  versa. Many popular languages such as Python, Perl,
                  and Ruby use a bridging approach based on wrappers
                  that must be written or generated in the host
                  language. Other languages like Jython and Kawa adopt
                  a fixed bridging strategy that exploits reflective
                  features provided by the host language. Although
                  both of these approaches are usable, they are
                  cumbersome and low-level. In particular, it can be
                  very difficult to adapt host language services to
                  cooperate seamlessly with abstractions of the
                  scripting language. In this paper we present a
                  lightweight bridging strategy for scripting and
                  composition languages that simplifies the task of
                  adapting host language services to the abstraction
                  level of the scripting language. This strategy uses
                  introspection facilities of the host language to
                  automate the wrapping process, while providing a
                  hook for programmer-defined adaptation of the
                  generated interface. A meta-level bridging layer is
                  responsible for wrapping and unwrapping both host
                  and scripting language entities so they can
                  seamlessly cooperate. The bridging strategy employs
                  partial evaluation of wrapping and unwrapping
                  operations to achieve acceptable performance.},

	Abstract = {Inheritance is well-known and accepted as a
                  fundamental mechanism for reuse in object-oriented
                  languages. Unfortunately, the main variants ---
                  single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and mixin
                  inheritance --- all suffer from conceptual and
                  practical problems related to software reuse and
                  robustness with respect to changes. In a rst part of
                  this thesis, we identify and illustrate these
                  problems. To overcome these problems, we then
                  present traits, a simple compositional model that
                  extends single inheritance. A trait is essentially a
                  (parameterized) set of methods; it serves as a
                  behavioral building block for classes and is the
                  primitive unit of code reuse. We develop a formal
                  model of traits that establishes how traits can be
                  composed to form other traits or classes, and we
                  describe how we implemented traits in Squeak
                  Smalltalk by bootstrapping a new language kernel. We
                  present our experimental validation in which we
                  apply traits to refactor parts of the Smalltalk
                  kernel and library, and we develop a programming
                  methodology around the usage of traits and the trait
                  browser, the tool that we implemented to take full
                  advantage of the availability of traits in the
                  Squeak programming environment.},

                  contains data about patient demographics and
                  history, consultations, drug administration,
                  practice management and inventory, finances and
                  accounting, laboratory, etc. Archie provides a
                  platform for Elexis and for all installed plug-ins
                  to easily and rapidly create statistical reports
                  without having to be concerned with recurring
                  aspects such as data input and output, form
                  validation, result presentation, or the user
                  interface in general. Data visualization is handled
                  entirely by Archie, it just requires the raw data to
                  adhere to a defined standard.},

@mastersthesis{Schl03a,
	Abstract = {Inheritance is a key concept of object-oriented
                  programming languages, features such as conceptual
                  modeling and reusability are largely accredited to
                  it. While many useful components have been, and will
                  be, developed in this paradigm, the form of
                  white-box reuse covered by inheritance has a
                  fundamental flaw: reusing components by inheritance
                  requires an understanding of the internals of the
                  components. We can not treat components of
                  object-oriented languages as black-box entities,
                  inheritance breaks encapsulation and introduces
                  subtle dependencies between base and extending
                  classes. Component-oriented programming addresses
                  this problem by shifting away from programming
                  towards software composition. We build applications
                  by scripting components. Instead of overriding the
                  internals of a component, we focus on composing its
                  interfaces only. This form of black-box reuse leads
                  to a flexible and extendible architecture with
                  reusable components. In this master's thesis we
                  propose a migration strategy from class
                  inheritance---a whitebox form of reuse---to
                  component composition as a black-box form of reuse.
                  We present a language extension that gives us the
                  power of inheritance combined with the ease of
                  scripting. It enables us to reuse Java components
                  using inheritance in JPiccola---a small, pure and
                  general composition language implemented on the Java
                  platform---at a high level of abstraction. Using the
                  services provided by the language extension we can
                  seamlessly generate interfaces and subclasses from
                  JPiccola. This capability greatly increases the
                  number of components scriptable from JPiccola. To
                  validate the usefulness of our language extension we
                  demonstrate how we can script various Java
                  components by de ning services and compositional
                  styles. We thus turn white-box components of Java
                  into black-box components in Piccola.},

	Abstract = {The development of flexible and reusable concurrent
                  object-oriented programming abstractions has
                  suffered from the inherent problem that reusability
                  and extensibility is limited due to
                  position-dependent parameters. To tackle this
                  problem, we propose the Form-calculus, an inherently
                  polymorphic variant of the Pi-calculus, where
                  polyadic tuple communication is replaced by monadic
                  communication of extensible records. This approach
                  facilitates the specification of flexible,
                  concurrent, object-oriented programming
                  abstractions. Based on our previous work in this
                  field, we present a Form-calculus based meta-level
                  approach for concurrent, object-based programming
                  which adapts a compositional view of programming.
                  This approach enables the definition of various
                  semantic models supporting different kinds of
                  inheritance and method dispatch strategies, and
                  clarifies concepts which are typically merged in

	Abstract = {To address the problems of traditional software
                  development methodologies, recent years have seen
                  the introduction of more light-weight or "agile"
                  development processes. These processes are intended
                  to support early and quick production of working
                  code by structuring the development into small
                  release cycles and focus on continual interaction
                  between developers and customers. As these kinds of
                  software development processes are becoming more and
                  more popular in industry, there is a growing demand
                  to expose Software Engineering students to agile
                  development practices. This, however, is not a
                  straightforward task as the corresponding practices
                  cannot be adjusted easily to a learning environment
                  or may even run counter to educational goals. In
                  this paper, we discuss our experiences in
                  introducing agile practices in student software
                  development projects and reflect on both the
                  benefits and drawbacks of agile processes in this

	Abstract = {For the development of present-day applications,
                  programming languages supporting high order
                  abstractions are needed. These high order
                  abstractions are called components. Since most of
                  the currently available programming languages and
                  systems fail to provide sufficient support for
                  specifying and implementing components, we are
                  developing a new language suitable for software
                  composition. It is not clear how such a language
                  will look like, what kind of abstractions it must
                  support, and what kind of formal model it will be
                  based on. Object-oriented programming languages
                  address some of the needs of present-day
                  applications, and it is therefore obvious to
                  integrate some of their concepts and abstractions in
                  the language. As a first step towards such an
                  integration, we have to define an object model.
                  Since no generally accepted formal object model
                  exists, we have chosen the Pi-calculus as a basis
                  for modelling. In order to find a suitable object
                  model, we have built up an object modelling
                  workbench for Pict, an implementation of an
                  asynchronous Pi-calculus. In this work, we define a
                  first abstract object model, describe several
                  implementations of the object model in Pict, and
                  discuss interesting features and possible
                  extensions.},

	Abstract = {The development of concurrent object-based
                  programming languages has suffered from the lack of
                  any generally accepted formal foundation for
                  defining their semantics. Therefore we are seeking
                  for a minimal semantic foundation for defining
                  features of concurrent object-based languages. Our
                  previous work has shown that the Pi-calculus is a
                  promising formal foundation for modelling objects,
                  and we have defined an object model integrating
                  common features of object-oriented programming
                  languages. Our goal is to define a black-box
                  framework for modelling objects. As a first
                  extension of our Pi-calculus based object model, we
                  present in this work the integration of abstractions
                  for synchronizing concurrent objects. Our results
                  show that objects are most easily synchronized when
                  synchronization policies are reified as first class
                  entities (i.e. metaobjects) and that McHale's
                  concept of ``generic synchronization policies''
                  forms a promising base for the definition of

@phdthesis{Schn99a,
	Abstract = {The last decade has shown that object-oriented
                  technology alone is not enough to cope with the
                  rapidly changing requirements of present-day
                  applications. Typically, objectoriented methods do
                  not lead to designs that make a clear separation
                  between computational and compositional aspects.
                  Component-based systems, on the other hand, achieve
                  flexibility by clearly separating the stable parts
                  of systems (i.e. the components) from the
                  specification of their composition. Components are
                  black-box entities that encapsulate services behind
                  well-defined interfaces. The essential point is that
                  components are not used in isolation, but according
                  to a software architecture which determines the
                  interfaces that components may have and the rules
                  governing their composition. A component, therefore,
                  cannot be separated from a component framework.
                  Naturally, it is not enough to have components and
                  frameworks, but one needs a way to plug components
                  together. However, one of the main problems with
                  existing languages and systems is that there is no
                  generally accepted definition of how components can
                  be composed. In this thesis, we argue that the
                  flexibility and adaptability needed for
                  component-based applications to cope with changing
                  requirements can be substantially enhanced if we do
                  not only think in terms of components, but also in
                  terms of architectures, scripts, and glue.
                  Therefore, we present a conceptual framework for
                  componentbased software development incorporating
                  the notions of components and frameworks, software
                  architectures, glue, as well as scripting and
                  coordination, which allows for an algebraic view of
                  software composition. Furthermore, we define the
                  FORM calculus, an offspring of the asynchronous
                  Pi-calculus, as a formal foundation for a
                  composition language that makes the ideas of the
                  conceptual framework concrete. The FORM calculus
                  replaces the tuple communication of the Pi-calculus
                  by the communication of forms (or extensible
                  records). This approach overcomes the problem of
                  position-dependent arguments, since the contents of
                  communications are now independent of positions and,
                  therefore, makes it easier to define flexible and
                  extensible abstractions. We use the FORM calculus to
                  define a (meta-level) framework for concurrent,
                  objectoriented programming and show that common
                  object-oriented programming abstractions such as
                  instance variables and methods, different method
                  dispatch strategies as well as synchronization are
                  most easily modelled when class metaobjects are
                  explicitly reified as first-class entities and when
                  a compositional view of object-oriented abstractions
                  is adopted. Finally, we show that both, polymorphic
                  form extension and restriction are the basic
                  composition mechanisms for forms and illustrate that
                  they are the key concepts for defining extensible
                  and adaptable, hence reusable higher-level
                  compositional abstractions.},

                  genericity and efficiency. This technique has proved
                  useful within the domains of imperative, functional,
                  and logical languages, but so far has not been
                  explored within the domain of object-oriented
                  languages. We present experiments in the
                  specialization of {Java} programs. We demonstrate
                  how to construct a program specializer for {Java}
                  programs from an existing specializer for C programs
                  and a {Java}-to-C compiler. Specialization is
                  managed using a declarative approach that abstracts
                  over the optimization process and masks
                  implementation details. Our experiments show that
                  program specialization provides a four-time speedup
                  of an image-filtering program. Based on these
                  experiments, we identify optimizations of
                  object-oriented programs that can be carried out by
                  automatic program specialization. We argue that

                  form, often at a higher level of abstraction,
                  state-of-the-art tools aid in reducing complexity
                  and gaining insights into parts of a system's
                  structure. However, orientation and navigation among
                  these representations remains difficult. Often
                  superfluously tool-induced effort is needed to
                  perform a certain task. We call this artificially
                  added effort friction. Tools with the right
                  navigation support can reduce this friction, and
                  increase productivity. This work classifies
                  navigation in models of object-oriented software

                  which each rank the same set of items according to

                  closest as possible to each ranking result to be
                  combined. In the context of the Internet, it can be
                  used to rank web pages into an order that best
                  reflects a balance between several criteria. In the
                  context of sports, we propose to use the method to
                  determine the winner of competitions, when the
                  performance of an athlete is naturally judged
                  according to different criteria, such as figure

                  theory, we can identify the structural hardness of
                  an instance and allow for choosing a high-performing
                  algorithm accordingly. We present efficient and
                  effective data reduction rules which will reduce
                  param- eters measuring the structural difficulty of
                  an instance provably by simplifying the instance or
                  removing unneeded parts. We provide efficient search
                  tree algorithms which will solve practically
                  relevant instances, where the criteria correlate
                  strongly. Experiments with synthetic data confirm
                  that for instances with high correlation between the
                  rankings, even large instances can be computed in
                  short time. For general instances, we present two
                  enumeration algorithms, which will likely outperform
                  the trivial algorithm of trying all rankings and
                  comparing their qualities as aggregations. We prove
                  the enumeration algorithms to perform well in
                  scenarios with both few items to be ranked and some
                  correlation between the rankings. We present methods
                  to approximate the solution quality by a factor of
                  two. We present parameters which cannot be used to
                  improve computation by proving the NP-hardness of
                  the problem even for small values of these
                  parameters.},

    In today's practice, no automated scheme is in place to inform both parties of any distant
    changes of the code. As code snippets continues to evolve both on the side of the user and on
    the side of the author, both may wish to benefit from remote bug fixes or refinements ---
    authors may be interested in the actual usage of their code snippets, and researchers could
    gather information on clone usage. We propose maintaining a link between software clones

	Abstract = {As software systems grow, reverse engineering is
                  becoming an increasingly important task. The larger
                  the system grows the more complex it becomes and the
                  more effort must be put in to understand it.
                  Consequently, the knowledge of the developers
                  becomes more and more critical for the process of
                  understanding the system. However, in large systems
                  not all developers know about the entire system.
                  Thus, to make the best use of developer knowledge,
                  we need to know which developer is knowledgeable in
                  which part of it. This thesis aims to provide a
                  lightweight approach to understand how developers
                  changed the system, when and where they worked and
                  which developer owned which part of the system. To
                  answer them, we define the Ownership Map
                  visualization based on the notion of code ownership
                  and measurements. We semantically group files and
                  identify behavioral patterns of the developer's
                  work.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the concepts of wide classes
                  and widening as extensions to the object model of
                  class-based languages such as {Java} and Smalltalk.
                  Widening allows an object to be temporarily widened,
                  that is transformed into an instance of a subclass,
                  a wide class, and, later on, to be shrunk, that is
                  reshaped to its original class. Wide classes share
                  the main properties of plain classes: they have a
                  name, a superclass, they may be instantiated, they
                  have an associated class predicate and an associated
                  type that may be used to override function
                  definitions. Widening is also useful to implement
                  transient data storage for long-lasting
                  computations. In particular, it helps reducing
                  software data retention. This phenomenon arises when
                  the actual data structures used in a program fail to
                  reflect time-dependent properties of values and can
                  cause excessive memory consumption during the
                  execution. Wide classes may be implemented for any
                  dynamically-typed class-based programming language
                  with very few modifications to the existing runtime
                  system. We describe the simple and efficient
                  implementation strategy used in the Bigloo runtime
                  system. Keywords: language implementation, dynamic
                  inheritance, dynamic type checking, instance
                  modification.},

	Abstract = {We describe a general technique for identifying
                  modules in legacy code. The method is based on
                  concept analysis---a branch of lattice theory that
                  can be used to identify similarities among a set of
                  objects based on their attributes. We discuss how
                  concept analysis can identify potential modules
                  using both "positive" and "negative" information. We
                  present an algorithmic framework to construct a
                  lattice of concepts from a program, where each
                  concept represents a potential module. We define the
                  notion of a concept partition, present an algorithm
                  for discovering all concept partitions of a given
                  concept lattice, and prove the algorithm correct.},

@incollection{Smia10a,
	Abstract = {Reuse of software artifacts (blueprints and code) is
                  normally associated with organising a systematic
                  reuse framework most often constructed for a
                  specific problem domain. In this paper we present a
                  system (language, tool, reuse process) where
                  software reuse is based on building and retrieving
                  of so-called software cases (large compound
                  artifacts) that can be reused between domains. The
                  system is opportunistic in that software cases
                  result from usual (non-reuse oriented) activities
                  where also semantic information is added. This
                  information is used to support regular development
                  but may serve later to retrieve software cases.
                  Having this common semantic basis, we can organise a
                  systematic cross-domain reuse process where
                  application logic of one system can be reused for
                  systems within different domains.},

	Summary = {This paper emphasizes the interactive features of the dotplot implementation. They integrate dotplots with other methods of sequence alignments, e.g. BLAST, superimposing the results in one display. The advantage of interaction is here that it allows exploration of the dotplot, since it may be that there is no optimal parameter setting which allows to find all the important sequence alignments. It may be that some of the alignments are only visible if there is still some background noise present. In their own words: "In cases like this, it is desirable to view the dot-plot under many different stringency conditions and be able to change them in a scrolling fashion." \fullcite{Sonn95}{4. Discussion}{9} They argue in favor of dotplots: * Graphical dot-matrix plots can provide the most complete and detailed comparison of two sequences. * Dotplots are best suited for homology analysis tasks involving weak and difficult to assess matches in both traditional protein or DNA comparisons and in more complex situations when genomic DNA is compared to proteins or DNA.},

                  components. It is designed to support different
                  composition styles. Furthermore, mixins and mixin
                  layers are a powerfull composition style. So it was
                  an interesting question if mixins and mixin layers
                  could be implemented with Piccola. To prove this I
                  first simulated the structure for mixins and then
                  implemented a small mixin layer library for graph
                  manipulation.},

	Abstract = {Source code search is an important activity for
                  programmers working on a change task to a software
                  system. We are at the early stages of a research
                  program that is aiming to answer three research
                  questions: (1) How effectively can programmers
                  express (using today's tools) the information they
                  are seeking? (2) How effectively can programmers
                  determine which of the matches returned from their
                  searches are relevant to their task? and (3) In what
                  ways can tools be improved to support programmers in
                  more effectively expressing their information needs
                  and exploring the results of searches? To begin
                  answering these questions we have conducted a study
                  in which we gathered both qualitative and
                  quantitative data about programmers' search
                  activities. Our analysis of this data is still
                  incomplete, however this paper presents several of
                  our initial observations about how programmers
                  interact with the results from their searches.},

	Abstract = {Since software systems must evolve to cope with
                  changing demands, the investment of time and effort
                  won't cease after first delivery. Developers that
                  join a project later in the development cycle may
                  have a hard time to understand the structure of
                  complex systems. Moreover they may not know about
                  concepts that emerged from earlier implementations.
                  We therefore want to find out what exactly happens
                  during evolution of software systems. We developed a
                  method based on simple metric heuristics to detect
                  changes between different versions of a software
                  system. With our query-based approach we can measure
                  overall changes in terms of removals and additions
                  in the code. We are also able to detect different
                  kinds of refactorings like restructuring in the
                  class hierarchy and moved features between entities.
                  Historical information about code size and changes
                  in the code structure helps us to find interesting
                  patterns and to discover unknown relationships and
                  dependencies among source code entities.},

	Abstract = {Mixin-based inheritance is an inheritance technique
                  that has been shown to subsume a variety of
                  different inheritance mechanisms. It is based
                  directly upon an incremental modification model of
                  inheritance. This paper addresses the question of
                  how mixins can be seen as named attributes of
                  classes the same way that objects, methods, and also
                  classes in their own right, are seen as named
                  attributes of classes. The general idea is to let a
                  class itself have control over how it is extended.
                  This results in a powerful abstraction mechanism to
                  control the construction of inheritance hierarchies
                  in two ways. Firstly, by being able to constrain the
                  inheritance hierarchy; secondly, by being able to
                  extend a class in a way that is specific for that
                  class. Nested mixins are a direct consequence of
                  having mixins as attributes. The scope rules for
                  nested mixins are discussed, and shown to preserve
                  the encapsulation of objects.},

	Abstract = {Current visual application builders and application
                  frameworks do not live up to their expectations of
                  rapid application development or
                  non-programming-expert application development. They
                  fall short when compared to component-oriented
                  development environments in which applications are
                  built with components that have a strong affinity
                  with the problem domain (i.e. being
                  domain-specific). Although the latter environments
                  are very powerful, they are hard to build and, in
                  general, do not allow much variation in the problem
                  domain that is covered. In this paper we show how
                  this apparent conflict between generality and domain
                  specificity can be overcome by considering
                  application building itself as the problem domain.
                  This naturally leads to the notion of a reflective
                  application builder, i.e. an application
                  framework-application builder pair that incorporates
                  all the tools for the visual construction of
                  (domain-specific) application builders.},

	Abstract = {Cross-cutting concerns in OOP lead to scattered and
                  tangled code that reduces transparency and
                  maintainability of a program, and produces
                  duplicated code. Common examples of cross-cutting
                  concerns are logging, caching or database
                  transactions in an application. Rather than trying
                  to break down such concerns into classes and
                  objects, the entity of modularization in
                  aspect-oriented programming (AOP) are aspects. An
                  aspect in AOP is the pendant of an object in OOP.
                  With aspects such problems can be solved much easier
                  and can be isolated into single entities. AOP can be
                  seen as programming paradigm that builds on top of
                  an existing paradigm and language. Today most AOP is
                  done on top of OOP. Dynamic Aspects is a lightweight
                  AOP implementation for Squeak Smalltalk that profits
                  from the advanced reflection tools developed by the
                  Software Composition Group. Sub-method level
                  reflection allows to select single statements within
                  methods. Annotation of such statements allows
                  extrinsic addition of behavior at any location in
                  code. Finally, the idea of partial behavioral
                  reflection gives the system great flexibility. All
                  those tools are the core Dynamic Aspects builds
                  upon. Beyond the basic AOP implementation, Dynamic
                  Aspects links to the field of context-oriented
                  programming and shows how contexts can be used in
                  aspects. Furthermore, the idea of control flow is
                  generalized and generic flow is implemented with
                  contexts.},

	Abstract = {Several graphics file formats exist today, each with
                  its own strengths and weaknesses. However, most of
                  them are static formats. Adobe's Flash File Format
                  (SWF) takes another approach. It is a vector
                  graphics format which comes with a built-in script
                  language, allowing the user to directly interact
                  with the graphics. Furthermore, SWF has other
                  interesting aspects like its popularity and
                  availability, support for alpha blending or the
                  possibility to include video and sound. The goal of
                  this thesis is to provide a solution to create SWF
                  files directly from Smalltalk. We present our
                  implementation named Basil and as a validation we
                  show how to use it for visualization purposes.},

                  Package Surface Blueprint, that qualifies the
                  relationships that a package has with its neighbors.
                  Large object-oriented applications are structured
                  over a large number of packages. Packages are
                  important but complex structural entities that may
                  be difficult to understand since they play different
                  development roles (i.e. class containers, code
                  ownership, basic structure, architectural
                  elements...). Maintainers of large applications face
                  the problem of understanding how packages are
                  structured in general and how they relate to each
                  other. A Package Surface Blueprint represents
                  packages around the notion of package surfaces:
                  groups of relationships according to the packages
                  they refer to. We present two specific views: one
                  stressing the references made by a package, and
                  another showing the inheritance structure of a
                  package. We applied the visualization on two large
                  case studies: ArgoUML and Squeak.},

@mastersthesis{Tale03a,
	Abstract = {Software Reengineering is a main issue in software
                  industry. One of its main activities, reverse
                  engineering, is concerned with trying to understand
                  a software system and how it ticks. For the
                  investigation and graphical representation of large
                  and complex systems there are various tools for
                  automated support. However, the information
                  extraction with these tools is di cult, visualising
                  certain aspects of a software system may overwhelm
                  the observer with its complexity. We discuss in this
                  work an object-oriented reverse engineering approach
                  using grouping. The intention of grouping is to
                  create groups with components of a software system.
                  The use of grouping has many benefits for a reverse
                  engineer: it supports the program understanding and
                  the design recovery, it adds higher abstraction
                  levels to the system, and it permits to create di
                  erent representations as well as alternate views of
                  a system. Furthermore, the use of groups and the
                  scalability of grouping are effective in reducing
                  the complexity of large systems. All the information
                  we need to create groups is found in the software
                  system. User-defined queries on the system perform
                  the selection of components for the creation of new
                  groups. We introduce the visualisation of groups and
                  show their usefulness with a Smalltalk case study.},

	Abstract = {Generic types in programming languages are most
                  often supported with various forms of parametric
                  polymorphism, i.e. functions on types. Within the
                  framework of object-oriented languages, virtual
                  types present an alternative where specific types
                  are derived from generic ones using inheritance
                  rather than function application. While both
                  mechanisms are statically safe and support basic
                  genericity, they have very different typing
                  properties, each of them providing for the
                  description of useful relationships, which are not
                  expressible with the other. In this paper we
                  present, through the use of examples, a mechanism
                  for describing generic classes: structural virtual
                  types. This mechanism is essentially a merger of
                  parameterized classes and virtual types and includes
                  the benefits of both, in particular retaining mutual
                  recursion and covariance of virtual types as well as
                  the function-like nature of parameterized classes.},

	Abstract = {The distributed nature of a typical web application
                  combined with the rapid evolution of underlying
                  platforms demands for a plug-in component
                  architecture. Nevertheless, code for controlling
                  distributed activities is usually spread over
                  multiple subsystems, which makes it hard to
                  dynamically reconfigure coordination services. This
                  paper investigates coordination components as a way
                  to encapsulate the coordination of a distributed
                  system into a separate, pluggable entity. In an
                  object-oriented context we introduce two design
                  guidelines (namely, "turn contracts into objects"
                  and "turn configuration into a factory object") that
                  help developers to separate coordination from
                  computation and to develop reusable and flexible
                  solutions for coordination in distributed systems.},

	Abstract = {The increased popularity of the object-oriented
                  paradigm has also increased the interest in
                  object-oriented reengineering. First of all,
                  object-oriented software systems suffer from similar
                  maintainability problems as traditional procedural
                  systems, displaying the need for reengineering
                  techniques tailored to deal with object- oriented
                  code. Secondly, the increased importance of
                  iterative development processes make reengineering
                  techniques valuable in forward engineering, and thus
                  for all paradigms that software is developed in.
                  Reengineering requires tool support to deal with the
                  large amounts of information and the wide variety of
                  tasks to be performed. An important consideration in
                  building tool environments for reengineering is what
                  information must be provided and how this
                  information is modelled. Design choices have a
                  considerable impact not only on the ability to
                  support reengineering tasks, but also on issues such
                  as scalability and tool interoperability. Several
                  metamodels exist that model software for the
                  purposes of reengineering. However, they generally
                  lack a discussion of the relevance of information
                  for reengineering and the trade-offs of modeling
                  alternatives. This thesis presents FAMIX, a
                  language-independent metamodel for modelling
                  object-oriented software for reengineering
                  purposes.We discuss the exact contents of the
                  metamodel, including its relevance for reengineering
                  and how the metamodel supports the different
                  object-oriented languages through its language-
                  independent core. We also discuss the
                  infrastructural design decisions of FAMIX by placing
                  it into a design space for infrastructural aspects
                  of reengineering repositories and metamodels. The
                  design space presents multiple interdependent
                  aspects, their design alternatives and howthese
                  impact issues such as scalability, extensibility and
                  information exchange. We validate the ability of
                  FAMIXto support reengineering on a
                  language-independent level in twoways. First, we
                  present Moose, a reengineering tool environment with
                  a repository based on FAMIX. Moose serves as a
                  foundation for multiple reengineering tools and has
                  been applied to reverse engineer several large
                  industrial case studies. Secondly,we define a set of
                  fifteen low-level refactorings in terms of the
                  information available in FAMIX. Refactoring requires
                  sufficient, complete and 100\% correct information as
                  well as a clear interpretation of the supported
                  languages in the language-independent core of the
                  metamodel, in order to correctly perform
                  transformations on the language-specific code level.
                  As such the refactorings provide an in-depth
                  validation of the language independence of FAMIX.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated software development for open
                  distributed systems in order to make this
                  development easier. Easier in the sense that
                  software parts will be better reusable, more
                  flexible and better maintainable. The hardest part
                  is to address evolution of these systems because not
                  all application requirements can be known in
                  advance. In particular we have investigated the
                  coordination aspects of open distributed systems.
                  Coordination technology addresses the management of
                  interaction of software agents in a distributed or
                  parallel environment and, therefore, typically
                  describes architectural aspects of a system. To
                  reach the goal of easier software development we
                  have applied a component oriented approach: generic
                  coordination solutions are provided as generic
                  architectures with black box components.
                  Applications are constructed using these
                  architectures and composing and parameterizing these
                  generic components. In this way we make the
                  interaction part of a system reusable and flexible.
                  The architecture of the system is also made clearer
                  and therefore easier understandable. A prototype
                  coordination framework and a set of sample
                  applications that are representative for open
                  distributed systems and that use this framework,
                  have been developed in the concurrent
                  object-oriented programming language {Java}. We show
                  that, using our component-oriented approach, we gain
                  reusability, flexibility and provide clear
                  architectures of applications. A major problem,
                  however, concerning the genericity of components, is
                  the application dependent information that may be
                  needed by a coordination solution: the genericity of
                  the solution is strongly dependent on the
                  possibility to separate this information from the
                  generic solution.},

                  reengineering of large scale object-oriented
                  systems. However, due to the heterogeneity in
                  today's object-oriented programming languages, it is
                  hard to reuse reengineering tools across legacy
                  systems. This paper proposes a language independent
                  exchange model, so that tools may perform their
                  tasks independent of the underlying programming
                  language. Beside supporting reusability between
                  tools, we expect that this exchange model will
                  enhance the interoperability between tools for
                  metrics, visualization, reorganisation and other

                  interoperability and evolution on rapidly evolving
                  platforms such as the World Wide Web, parts of
                  applications are increasingly packaged as
                  components. Encapsulating the coordination of these
                  multiple subsystems as generic components has proven
                  difficult, because typically coordination affects
                  multiple components and in open systems a whole set
                  of other requirements, such as interoperability and
                  security, must also be dealt with. We have
                  investigated coordination as a variability aspect of
                  open distributed systems and we present concrete
                  solutions and limitations designing coordination
                  solutions as components. Our observations will help
                  developers to separate coordination from computation

                  We then propose a programming language, called DROL,
                  for asynchronous real-time computing. It supports
                  self-contained active objects that have threads of
                  control and a clock, and introduces the notion of
                  timed invocation, that guarantees the survivability
                  of each active object. We place DROL as a first step
                  in constructing programming languages to realize the
                  above three notions. We also classify distributed
                  computation into four forms according to asynchrony
                  and real-time properties, and try to develop
                  formalisms for the four categories based on a
                  process calculus. The formalisms allow us to
                  describe and analyze both globally and locally
                  temporal properties as well as the behavioral
                  properties of distributed objects and the
                  interactions among them. We discuss issues remaining
                  to be solved and suggest some possibilities for
                  future work.},

                  behavioral specification by event structures. We

                  manage the information the messages contain.
                  Database management systems manage the information
                  of a global database but do not have a notion of
                  address. In this paper we outline a prototype system
                  which integrates the facilities of message systems
                  and database management systems. The system manages
                  structured messages according to their contents. The
                  messages can be stored within a station and
                  transferred between stations. Information present in
                  the messages can be queried in a distributed manner.
                  Message structure can also be exploited by automatic

                  facilities: the ability of objects to migrate to new
                  environments, and the ability of objects to acquire
                  new operations dynamically. This paper proposes
                  Knos, an object-oriented environment which supports
                  these actions. Their operations, data structures,
                  and communication mechanisms are discussed. Kno
                  objects "learn" by exporting and importing new or
                  modified operations. The use of such objects as
                  intellectual support tools is outlined. In
                  particular, various applications involving
                  co-operation, negotiation, and apprenticeship among

                  independence versus data independence. We discuss
                  the ways in which this difference in outlook
                  manifests itself, and we consider the possibilities
                  for resolving the two views, including the current
                  work on object-oriented databases. We conclude by
                  proposing an approach to co-existence that blurs the

                  Perspectives provide a uniform model for views,

                  specification and software composition, the software

	Abstract = {It is a generally accepted fact that software
                  systems are constructed and gradually refined over a
                  period of time. During this time, code is written
                  and modified until stable releases of the system
                  emerge. Many researchers have studied systems over a
                  longer period of time in order to understand how
                  they change and evolve. Despite these efforts, we
                  still lack a precise understanding how various
                  properties of software change over time, in
                  particular in the area of object-oriented systems.
                  Such an understanding is of great importance if we
                  want to come up with techniques to provide feedback
                  on the evolution of quality and predictions about
                  further evolution of software systems. Historically,
                  collection of sufficient data to build useful models
                  was not practical as source code and build histories
                  were not freely available. It is our opinion that by
                  focusing our attention towards Open source software
                  repositories, we have a better hope building
                  predictive models to help developers and managers.
                  In this paper, we will report on our exploratory
                  study analyzing Open source object oriented software
                  projects and present a first predictive model based

                  components, which, in general, undergo phased and
                  incremental development. In order to facilitate the
                  corresponding construction process, it is important
                  that the development team in charge has a good
                  understanding of how individual software components
                  typically evolve. Furthermore, software engineers
                  need to be able to recognize abnormal patterns of
                  growth with respect to size, structure, and
                  complexity of the components and the resulting
                  composite. Only if a development team understands
                  the processes that underpin the evolution of
                  software systems, will they be able to make better
                  development choices. In this paper, we analyze
                  recurring structural and evolutionary patterns that
                  we have observed in public-domain software systems
                  built using object-oriented programming languages.
                  Based on our analysis, we discuss common growth
                  patterns found in present-day component-based

                  developers in achieving a better understanding of
                  those patterns. As a consequence, we hope to raise
                  the awareness level in the community on how

	Abstract = {Real software systems change and become more complex
                  over time. But which parts change and which parts
                  remain stable? Common wisdom, for example, states
                  that in a well-designed object-oriented system, the
                  more popular a class is, the less likely it is to
                  change from one version to the next, since changes
                  to this class are likely to impact its clients. We
                  have studied consecutive releases of several public
                  domain, object-oriented software systems and
                  analyzed a number of measures indicative of size,
                  popularity, and complexity of classes and
                  interfaces. As it turns out, the distributions of
                  these measures are remarkably stable as an
                  application evolves. The distribution of class size
                  and complexity retains its shape over time.
                  Relatively little code is modified over time.
                  Classes that tend to be modified, however, are also
                  the more popular ones, that is, those with greater
                  Fan-In. In general, the more "complex" a class or
                  interface becomes, the more likely it is to change

                  useful information from vast amounts of software in
                  order to track development progress, to gain
                  insights into the nature of the software, and to
                  identify potential problems. Unfortunately, however,
                  many software metrics exhibit highly skewed,
                  non-Gaussian distributions. As a consequence, usual
                  ways of interpreting these metrics --- for example,
                  in terms of "average" values --- can be highly
                  misleading. Many metrics, it turns out, are
                  distributed like wealth --- with high concentrations
                  of values in selected locations. We propose to
                  analyze software metrics using the Gini coefficient,
                  a higher-order statistic widely used in economics to
                  study the distribution of wealth. Our approach
                  allows us not only to observe changes in software
                  systems efficiently, but also to assess project
                  risks and monitor the development process itself. We
                  apply the Gini coefficient to numerous metrics over
                  a range of software projects, and we show that many
                  metrics not only display remarkably high Gini
                  values, but that these values are remarkably
                  consistent as a project evolves over time.},

                  Types meant to describe the kind of messages an

	Abstract = {Industrial software systems are large and complex,
                  both in terms of the software entities and their
                  relationships. Consequently, understanding how a
                  software system works requires the ability to pose
                  queries over the design-level entities of the
                  system. Traditionally, this task has been supported
                  by simple tools (e.g., grep) combined with the
                  programmer's intuition and experience. Recently,
                  however, specialized code query technologies have
                  matured to the point where they can be used in
                  industrial situations, providing more intelligent,
                  timely, and efficient responses to developer
                  queries. This working session aims to explore the
                  state of the art in code query technologies, and
                  discover new ways in which these technologies may be
                  useful in program comprehension. The session brings
                  together researchers and practitioners. We survey
                  existing techniques and applications, trying to
                  understand the strengths and weaknesses of the
                  various approaches, and sketch out new frontiers
                  that hold promise.},

	Abstract = {When a software engineer has to maintain a system,
                  he needs to understand how the system is built. In
                  order to help engineers understand existing systems,
                  research has been conducted around automating the
                  process of architecture recovery. A first step
                  consists of building a straightforward browsable
                  model of the system. However, the conceptual level
                  of abstraction behind the design might be higher
                  than the available level of abstraction in the used
                  programming paradigm. Therefore, a second step which
                  retrieves this implicit information needs to be
                  undertaken. In his thesis, Rainer Koschke [Kos02]
                  has developed and evaluated several techniques which
                  retrieve implicit architectural information from
                  procedural systems. These techniques resulted in the
                  detection of atomic architectural components,
                  comparable to the concept of prototypes. More and
                  more systems are developed using the object-oriented
                  programming paradigm. Systems built using this
                  paradigm embed a similar, yet more coarsegrained,
                  type of implicit information. Here we think of a
                  higher level of abstraction, comparable to the
                  concept of software components. In this thesis, we
                  investigate if and how some of the component
                  detection heuristics, presented in the thesis by
                  Koschke, can be adapted as such that they are
                  applicable to object-oriented code in order to
                  detect components comparable to software components.
                  Additionaly, we investigate how we can complement
                  them with available object-oriented information.},

	Abstract = {Code executed in a fully reflective system switches
                  back and forth between application and interpreter
                  code. These two states can be seen as contexts in
                  which an expression is evaluated. Current language
                  implementations obtain reflective capabilities by
                  exposing objects to the interpreter. However, in
                  doing so these systems break the encapsulation of
                  the application objects. In this paper we propose
                  safe reflection through polymorphism, \ie by
                  unifying the interface and ensuring the
                  encapsulation of objects from both the interpreter
                  and application context. We demonstrate a
                  \emph{homogeneous system} that defines the execution
                  semantics in terms of itself, thus enforcing that
                  encapsulation is not broken.},

	Abstract = {High-performance virtual machines (VMs) are increasingly reused for programming languages for which they were not initially designed. Unfortunately, VMs are usually tailored to specific languages, offer only a very limited interface to running applications, and are closed to extensions. As a consequence, extensions required to support new languages often entail the construction of custom VMs, thus impacting reuse, compatibility and performance. Short of building a custom VM, the language designer has to choose between the expressiveness and the performance of the language. In this dissertation we argue that the best way to open the VM is to eliminate it. We present Pinocchio, a natively compiled Smalltalk, in which we identify and reify three basic building blocks for object-oriented languages.  First we define a protocol for message passing similar to calling conventions, independent of the actual message lookup mechanism. The lookup is provided by a self-supporting runtime library written in Smalltalk and compiled to native code. Since it unifies the meta- and base-level we obtain a metaobject protocol (MOP).  Then we decouple the language-level manipulation of state from the machine-level implementation by extending the structural reflective model of the language with object layouts, layout scopes and slots.  Finally we reify behavior using AST nodes and first-class interpreters separate from the low-level language implementation. We describe the implementations of all three first-class building blocks. For each of the blocks we provide a series of examples illustrating how they enable typical extensions to the runtime, and we provide benchmarks validating the practicality of the approaches.},

                  primitives. This good property was obtained by

	Abstract = {Object-oriented programming techniques have been
                  used with great success for some time. But the
                  techniques of object-oriented programming have been
                  largely confined to the single address space, and
                  have not been applicable to distributed systems.
                  Recent advances in language technology have allowed
                  a change in the way distributed systems are
                  constructed that does allow real object-oriented
                  programming on the network. But these advances also
                  change some of our most basic conceptions about the
                  relationship between processor and code, and what it
                  is that constitutes a computer. We will argue that a
                  new computing architecture, based around the ideas
                  of the network and full object-orientation, will
                  soon become the dominant computing architecture,
                  allowing us to tie together large numbers of devices
                  but requiring that we think and design in entirely
                  new ways.},

	Abstract = {In our life we often use examples to explain
                  difficult topics. Examples help us to comprehend the
                  problem. An example is easier to understand than an
                  abstract description of the problem. In software
                  design the problems are complex and abstract. But
                  examples are rarely used to explain a complicated
                  situation. We are using examples to document and
                  explain software. Examples demonstrate the creation
                  and behavior of an instance. They can be reused to
                  compose new examples. Examples can be extended with
                  assertions and become unit tests. Because the link
                  between test and method under test is often missing,
                  we created a meta-model for tests. Our meta-model
                  stores the objects, methods and parameters used for
                  the tests. It can generate the source code of its
                  tests which is human readable. First studies shows
                  that most unit tests are method tests concerning
                  only a single method call. The other tests can be
                  refactored to method tests. We built an editor for
                  the meta-model to create examples and tests. The
                  editor is integrated in the environment and lets the
                  developer create new tests with a minimal effort.},

@inproceedings{Wegn94a,
	Abstract = {Objects have inherently greater computation power
                  than functions because they provide clients with
                  continuing services over time. They determine a
                  \fImarriage contract\fP for interactive services
                  that cannot be expressed by a pattern of
                  time-independent \fIsales contracts\fP. Objects
                  express the programming-in-the-large paradigm of
                  software engineering, while functions express the
                  programming-in-the-small paradigm of the analysis of
                  algorithms. Objects have a \fIfunctional
                  semantics\fP specified by their interface, a
                  \fIserial semantics\fP specified by traces of
                  interface procedures, and a \fIfully abstract
                  semantics\fP that specifies behavior over time for
                  all possible interactions. They assign meaning to
                  the time between the execution of interface
                  procedures as well as to algorithmic effects.
                  Church's thesis that computable functions capture
                  the intuitive notion of effective computation for
                  algorithms cannot be extended to objects. Components
                  are defined by generalizing from accidental to
                  necessary properties of persistent interaction
                  units. Scalability for software problems, defined as
                  ``asymptotic openness'', is shown to be the analog
                  of complexity for algorithmic problems. Paradigms of
                  interaction are examined for functions and
                  procedures, objects and processes, APIs and
                  frameworks, databases, GUIs, robots, and
                  virtual-reality systems. Early models of computing
                  stressed computation over interaction for both
                  theoretical reasons (greater tractability) and
                  practical reasons (there were no software components
                  with which to interact). However, scalable software
                  systems, personal computers, and databases require a
                  balance between algorithmic and interactive problem
                  solving. Models of interaction express the behavior
                  of actual software systems and therefore capture the
                  intuitive notion of truly effective computation more
                  completely than mere algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Many researchers believe that object-oriented
                  languages are well suited for some of the
                  programming tasks associated with the building of an
                  office information system (OIS). To lend support to
                  this thesis, we shall concentrate our attention on
                  an object-oriented programming environment, named
                  Oz, which has been effectively employed to capture
                  certain aspects of OISs more simply and naturally
                  than with conventional languages. After pointing out
                  some of the limitations of Oz, we introduce
                  additional facilities into it which further enhance
                  its capabilities, especially with respect to the
                  management of office data.},

	Abstract = {Current implementations of reflective Java extensions
		 typically either require access to source code, or
		 require a modified Java platform. This makes them
		 unsuitable for applying reflection to
		 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems. In order to
		 address this we developed a prototype Java extension
		 Dalang based on class wrapping that worked with
		 compiled code, and was implemented using a standard
		 Java platform. In this paper we evaluate the class
		 wrapper approach, and discuss issues that relate to the
		 transparent application of reflection to COTS systems.
		 This has informed our design of a new version of Dalang
		 called Kava that implements a metaobject protocol
		 through the application of standard byte code
		 transformations. Kava leverages the capabilities of
		 byte code transformation toolkits whilst presenting a
		 high-level abstraction for specifying behavioural
		 changes to Java components.},

@article{Wimm13a,
	Abstract = {A highly productive platform accelerates the production of research results. The design of a Virtual Machine ({VM}) written in the Java{\texttrademark} programming language can be simplified through exploitation of interfaces, type and memory safety, automated memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and reflection. Moreover, modern Java {IDEs} offer time-saving features such as refactoring, auto-completion, and code navigation. Finally, Java annotations enable compiler extensions for low-level  '' systems programming'' while retaining {IDE} compatibility. These techniques collectively make complex system software more  '' approachable'' than has been typical in the past. The Maxine {VM}, a metacircular Java {VM} implementation, has aggressively used these features since its inception. A co-designed companion tool, the Maxine Inspector, offers integrated debugging and visualization of all aspects of the {VM}'s runtime state. The Inspector's implementation exploits advanced Java language features, embodies intimate knowledge of the {VM}'s design, and even reuses a significant amount of {VM} code directly. These characteristics make Maxine a highly approachable {VM} research platform and a productive basis for research and teaching.},

@inproceedings{Wing94a,
	Abstract = {Distributed systems are different from concurrent
                  (and parallel) systems because they need to deal
                  with failures, not just concurrency. Transactions
                  are a way of masking the distributed nature of a
                  computation at the programming language level by
                  transforming all failures into aborted transactions.
                  If a communication link goes down or a node crashes,
                  the transaction simply aborts. Users may try again
                  later to rerun their computation, but they are at
                  least guaranteed that the system is left in some
                  consistent state. Transactions are a well-known and
                  fundamental control abstraction that arose out of
                  the database community. They have three properties
                  that distinguish them from normal sequential
                  processes: (1) A transaction is a sequence of
                  operations that is performed atomically
                  ("all-or-nothing"). If it completes successfully, it
                  commits ; otherwise, it aborts ; (2) concurrent
                  transactions are serializable (appear to occur
                  one-at-a-time), supporting the principle of
                  isolation; and (3) effects of committed transactions
                  are persistent (survive failures).},

@inproceedings{Wuyt01f,
	Abstract = {When developing software systems, the relation
                  between design and implementation is typically left
                  unspecified. As a result design or implementation
                  can be modified independently of each other, and a
                  modification of either one does not leave any trace
                  in the other. The practical result of this is a
                  number of well-known problems such as drift and
                  erosion, documentation maintenance problems or
                  round-trip engineering trouble. To solve these
                  problems we propose to make the relation between des
                  ign and implementation explicit by expressing design
                  as a logic meta program over implementation. This is
                  the cornerstone for building a complete
                  synchronisation framework that allows one to
                  synchronise changes to design and implementation. We
                  have implem ented such synchronisation framework,
                  and applied it successfully on two case studies.},

	Abstract = {The objective of the 1st International Workshop on
                  Advanced Software Development Tools and Techniques
                  (WASDeTT-1) was to provide interested researchers
                  with a forum to share their tool building
                  experiences and to explore how tools can be built
                  more effectively and efficiently. The theme for this
                  workshop did focus on tools that target
                  object-oriented languages and that are implemented
                  with object-oriented languages. This workshop report
                  provides a brief overview of the presented tools and
                  of the discussions that took place. The presented
                  tools, 15 in total, covered a broad range of
                  functionalities, among them: refactoring, modeling,
                  behavioral specification, static and dynamic program
                  checking, user interface composition, and program
                  understanding. The discussion during the workshop
                  centered around the following topics: language
                  independent tools, tool building in an industrial
                  context, tool building methodology, tool
                  implementation language, and building tools with
                  external code.},

	Abstract = {Throughout its entire life cycle software
                  development is subject to many rules constraining
                  and guiding construction of software systems.
                  Examples are best-practice patterns, idioms, coding
                  conventions, design guidelines, architectural
                  patterns, etc. Although such regulations are widely
                  used, their usage is currently implicit or ad-hoc,
                  and most soft- ware development environments do not
                  explicitly support them. We present an approach to
                  declare explicitly software development styles in an
                  open declarative system that allows querying,
                  conformance check- ing and enforcement of these
                  declarations on the source code. We validate the
                  approach by expressing and supporting several
                  software development styles in a real-world case.},

	Abstract = {The maintenance or reengineering of object-oriented
                  system includes its reverse engineering, i.e. their
                  internal structure and behaviour needs to be
                  understood. Many researchers proposed different
                  techniques to support this work by static code or
                  dynamic behaviour analysis. Whereas the static code
                  analysis does not explore the behaviour of the
                  running system, the data collection for the dynamic
                  behaviour analysis produces a large amount of
                  data.\\ In this thesis we propose a novel
                  visualization technique which combines static code
                  with dynamic behaviour analysis. This technique
                  supports the software engineer to understand the
                  behaviour of software systems by visualizing it on
                  the basis of the internal structure. Using this
                  technique we focus on features, their detection
                  within the source code, hotspots of behaviour and
                  feature interaction as methods to understand how
                  different features behave in the target software

	Abstract = {In an evolving system maintained over a long time period, there exist
		many non-trivial relationships among system classes, such as class
		co-evolutions, which usually are not easily perceivable in the source
		code. However, unfortunately, the continuing evolution of large,
		long-lived systems leads to lost information about these hidden relationships.
		In this paper, we propose a method for recovering such lost knowledge
		by data mining method. This method relies on the UMLDiff algorithm
		that, given a sequence of UML class models of a system, surfaces
		the design-level changes over its life span, thus eliminating the
		need for high quality modification reports and nonintuitive software
		code-based metrics. We employ Apriori association rule mining algorithm to the transactional database of
		class modifications, which elicit previously unknown or undocumented
		co-evolving relations among two or more classes. The recovered knowledge
		facilitates the overall understanding of system evolution and the
		planning of future maintaining activities. We report on one real
		world case study evaluating our approach.},

                  language framework that deliberately separates
                  mechanism from policy. Mechanisms such as slot
                  access and message passing are designed to have a
                  natural semantics and to be efficient. Conventional
                  and controversial concepts such as class,
                  inheritance, and method combination, on the other
                  hand, are classified as policy, and are left open to
                  the user by providing so-called hook mechanisms. TAO
                  is a language conforming to this framework and has
                  only a few more than twenty primitives for
                  object-oriented programming. This paper also gives
                  examples illustrating how conventional concepts of
                  object-oriented programming can be implemented on
                  top of these primitives.},

                  constructing an operating system and its kernel with
                  object-oriented technology. We first propose
                  object/metaobject separation, a means of
                  constructing an object-oriented operating system and
                  its kernel. This method divides the implementing
                  system facilities and applications into two types:
                  objects and metaobjects. This paper presents the
                  concept of object/metaobject separation and
                  discusses why object/metaobject separation is
                  required in terms of limitations in the micro-kernel
                  and object-oriented technologies. We also discuss an
                  example of using object/metaobject separation as
                  implemented in Apertos. This paper then proposes
                  mechanisms which efficiently implement
                  object/metaobject separation. These are
                  characterized by meta-level context management, and
                  are implemented in the Apertos operating system.
                  Meta-level context management is designed to reduce
                  the overhead of control transfer between an object
                  and its metaspace. Here, metaobjects reflectors,
                  MetaCore, Context, and Activity are introduced to
                  represent the metahierarchy of an object's
                  execution. Finally, we present the evaluation
                  results of the Apertos implementation, and discuss
                  the relationship with previous work.},

                  simply defined as a named query expression, and
                  queries issued against views can be translated into
                  equivalent queries against databases by means of the
                  query modification technique as used i relational
                  database systems, and a view makes it possible for
                  its user to see a subset of its base objects, a
                  subset of the methods of its base objects, or new
                  relationships created by combining two or more sets
                  of its base objects.},

@inproceedings{Zeid94a,
	Abstract = {Distributed systems have become a buzz word, well
                  known but not well used, because of different
                  existing paradigms for programming languages,
                  systems, communication, coop eration, management,
                  and because of integraton problems. From the
                  programmer's point of view, the interesting question
                  is how one can solve a problem specification in a
                  distributed environment. Most of the existing
                  distributed programming environments concentrate on
                  two levels; First, the denotation of an operational
                  solution in a modularized way, and second,
                  description of an initial interconnection of these
                  modules into a distributed application, i.e.
                  configuration or structural programming. Both levels
                  are kept independent as far as possible, using
                  different notations and thus can not benefit from
                  each other because of their separation. This paper
                  introduces a model which integrates structural and
                  operational programming into a single paradigm. This
                  paradigm is based on object-orientation and
                  reflective programming extended by a category and
                  annotation model realizing structural programming
                  support.},

	Abstract = {Software systems undergo continual change if they
                  want to remain useful over time. However, only
                  limited support for change is offered by current
                  programming languages and development environments.
                  Although various existing efforts try to cope with
                  change and exploit it for different applications, a
                  unifying approach to support software change is
                  missing. We propose Changeboxes as a generic
                  metamodel to represent change as a first-class
                  entity. Changeboxes encapsulate the semantics of a
                  change process as well as its effects and model the
                  entire change history of a software system.
                  Changeboxes capture changes at the level of the
                  runtime system and the integrated development
                  environment. They are able to record low-level
                  changes as well as complex transformations like
                  refactorings. Each Changebox provides a scope for
                  dynamic execution, whereas several ones can be
                  concurrently active and thus enable different views
                  of the same software artifact within a single
                  running system. Changeboxes can be arbitrarily
                  extended, which enables one to explore several
                  development trails simultaneously. Multiple
                  Changeboxes may be merged in order to combine their
                  changes depending on a customizable conflict
                  resolution strategy. Our proof-of-concept
                  implementation showed to have an acceptable
                  performance and was used to demonstrate the impact
                  of Changeboxes on various domains. We discuss the
                  advantages that Changeboxes entail for evolving
                  software systems and propose selected topics for
                  further research.},

@misc{nuno02,
	Abstract = {The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) API shields
		 the developer from the details of distributed
		 programming, allowing him to concentrate on application
		 specific code. But to perform some operations that are
		 orthogonal to the application, like logging, auditing,
		 caching, QoS, fault tolerance, and security, sometimes
		 it is necessary to customize the default behavior of
		 the RMI runtime. Other middleware for distributed
		 programming, like CORBA and the Remoting framework of
		 the .NET platform, support smart proxies and
		 interceptors, which can be used for these purposes,
		 allowing the separation of application-specific code
		 from service-specific code. In RMI there is no direct
		 way of doing so. This paper presents a framework based
		 on the Dynamic Proxy API for using smart proxies and
		 interceptors with RMI. This framework requires no
		 changes in the client application and minimal changes
		 in the server application, giving the developer greater
		 control over the distributed application. A practical
		 example of use is also given, by using the described
		 framework to implement user authentication and
		 fine-grained access control in RMI.},

@article{Alpe00a,
	Abstract = {Jalape\~{n}o is a virtual machine for Java{\texttrademark} servers written in the Java language. To be able to address the requirements of servers (performance and scalability in particular), Jalape\~{n}o was designed  '' from scratch ''  to be as self-sufficient as possible. Jalape\~{n}o's unique object model and memory layout allows a hardware null-pointer check as well as fast access to array elements, fields, and methods. Run-time services conventionally provided in native code are implemented primarily in Java. Java threads are multiplexed by virtual processors (implemented as operating system threads). A family of concurrent object allocators and parallel type-accurate garbage collectors is supported. Jalape\~{n}o's interoperable compilers enable quasi-preemptive thread switching and precise location of object references. Jalape\~{n}o's dynamic optimizing compiler is designed to obtain high quality code for methods that are observed to be frequently executed or computationally intensive.},
