# Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo

This repository contains the sources of the book *Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo* by S.Â Ducasse with Damien Pollet.
It is a follow-up of *Botincs: Learning programming with Squeak*. But its contents are far more advanced and fun :).

Since I'm not a native English speaker, I appreciate pull requests that help me get the material in better form.

The version tagged v1.0 is based on Pharo6.0.
