# Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo

[![Build status][badge]][travis]

This repository contains the sources of the book *Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo* by S. Ducasse with Damien Pollet.
It is a follow up of *Botincs: Learning programming with Squeak*. But its contents are far more advanced and fun :).

Since I'm not a native english speaker, I appreciate pull requests that help me get the material in better form.
