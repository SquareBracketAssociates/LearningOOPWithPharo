Lindermayer systems, also called \emph{L-Systems}, have been developed
by biology theorists to understand and simulate the growth of plants
\cite{Pruz90a}. In the following chapters we propose you to implement
different L-Systems from a minimalist to elaborate
ones. Chapter~\ref{ch:lsystem} presents the simplest possible
L-Systems, i.e., L-System composed by one single rule.
Chapter~\ref{ch:lsystem2} presents an object-oriented model of
L-System that alleviate the limits of the previous implementation.
Chapter~\ref{ch:plant} defines a new class of turtle that allows one
to model plants with the L-Systems defined previously. Finally,
Chapter~\ref{ch:parametric} introduces Parametric L-Systems that
allows one to express more powerful L-Systems. This chapter shows in
particular how inheritance can be used to reuse class already defined.
